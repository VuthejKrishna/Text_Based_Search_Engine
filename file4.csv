5,A Child's History Of England,42,Charles Dickens,Chapter23,"Burning Daylight: Part II: Chapter XV        Part II    Chapter XV   On  the other hand, had he been the most artful of schemers he could not have  pursued a wiser policy. Bird-like in her love of individual freedom, the  last woman in the world to be bullied in her affections, she keenly appreciated  the niceness of his attitude. She did this consciously, but deeper than  all consciousness, and intangible as gossamer, were the effects of this.  All unrealizable, save for some supreme moment, did the web of Daylight's  personality creep out and around her. Filament by filament, these secret  and undreamable bonds were being established. They it was that could have  given the cue to her saying yes when she had meant to say no. And in some  such fashion, in some future crisis of greater moment, might she not, in  violation of all dictates of sober judgment, give another unintentional  consent?    Among other good things resulting from his growing intimacy with Dede,  was Daylight's not caring to drink so much as formerly. There was a lessening  in desire for alcohol of which even he at last became aware. In a way she  herself was the needed inhibition. The thought of her was like a cocktail.  Or, at any rate, she substituted for a certain percentage of cocktails.  From the strain of his unnatural city existence and of his intense gambling  operations, he had drifted on to the cocktail route. A wall must forever  be built to give him easement from the high pitch, and Dede became a part  of this wall. Her personality, her laughter, the intonations of her voice,  the impossible golden glow of her eyes, the light on her hair, her form,  her dress, her actions on horseback, her merest physical mannerisms--all,  pictured over and over in his mind and dwelt upon, served to take the place  of many a cocktail or long Scotch and soda.    In spite of their high resolve, there was a very measurable degree of  the furtive in their meetings. In essence, these meetings were stolen.  They did not ride out brazenly together in the face of the world. On the  contrary, they met always unobserved, she riding across the many-gated  backroad from Berkeley to meet him halfway. Nor did they ride on any save  unfrequented roads, preferring to cross the second range of hills and travel  among a church-going farmer folk who would scarcely have recognized even  Daylight from his newspaper photographs.    He found Dede a good horsewoman--good not merely in riding but in endurance.  There were days when they covered sixty, seventy, and even eighty miles;  nor did Dede ever claim any day too long, nor--another strong recommendation  to Daylight--did the hardest day ever the slightest chafe of the chestnut  sorrel's back. ""A sure enough hummer,"" was Daylight's stereotyped but ever  enthusiastic verdict to himself.    They learned much of each other on these long, uninterrupted rides.  They had nothing much to talk about but themselves, and, while she received  a liberal education concerning Arctic travel and gold-mining, he, in turn,  touch by touch, painted an ever clearer portrait of her. She amplified  the ranch life of her girlhood, prattling on about horses and dogs and  persons and things until it was as if he saw the whole process of her growth  and her becoming. All this he was able to trace on through the period of  her father's failure and death, when she had been compelled to leave the  university and go into office work. The brother, too, she spoke of, and  of her long struggle to have him cured and of her now fading hopes. Daylight  decided that it was easier to come to an understanding of her than he had  anticipated, though he was always aware that behind and under all he knew  of her was the mysterious and baffling woman and sex. There, he was humble  enough to confess to himself, was a chartless, shoreless sea, about which  he knew nothing and which he must nevertheless somehow navigate.    His lifelong fear of woman had originated out of non-understanding and  had also prevented him from reaching any understanding. Dede on horseback,  Dede gathering poppies on a summer hillside, Dede taking down dictation  in her swift shorthand strokes--all this was comprehensible to him. But  he did not know the Dede who so quickly changed from mood to mood, the  Dede who refused steadfastly to ride with him and then suddenly consented,  the Dede in whose eyes the golden glow forever waxed and waned and whispered  hints and messages that were not for his ears. In all such things he saw  the glimmering profundities of sex, acknowledged their lure, and accepted  them as incomprehensible.    There was another side of her, too, of which he was consciously ignorant.  She knew the books, was possessed of that mysterious and awful thing called  ""culture."" And yet, what continually surprised him was that this culture  was never obtruded on their intercourse. She did not talk books, nor art,  nor similar folderols. Homely minded as he was himself, he found her almost  equally homely minded. She liked the simple and the out-of-doors, the horses  and the hills, the sunlight and the flowers. He found himself in a partly  new flora, to which she was the guide, pointing out to him all the varieties  of the oaks, making him acquainted with the madrono and the manzanita,  teaching him the names, habits, and habitats of unending series of wild  flowers, shrubs, and ferns. Her keen woods eye was another delight to him.  It had been trained in the open, and little escaped it. One day, as a test,  they strove to see which could discover the greater number of birds' nests.  And he, who had always prided himself on his own acutely trained observation,  found himself hard put to keep his score ahead. At the end of the day he  was but three nests in the lead, one of which she challenged stoutly and  of which even he confessed serious doubt. He complimented her and told  her that her success must be due to the fact that she was a bird herself,  with all a bird's keen vision and quick-flashing ways.    The more he knew her the more he became convinced of this birdlike quality  in her. That was why she liked to ride, he argued. It was the nearest approach  to flying. A field of poppies, a glen of ferns, a row of poplars on a country  lane, the tawny brown of a hillside, the shaft of sunlight on a distant  peak--all such were provocative of quick joys which seemed to him like  so many outbursts of song. Her joys were in little things, and she seemed  always singing. Even in sterner things it was the same. When she rode Bob  and fought with that magnificent brute for mastery, the qualities of an  eagle were uppermost in her.    These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him. He joyed  in her joy, his eyes as excitedly fixed on her as bears were fixed on the  object of her attention. Also through her he came to a closer discernment  and keener appreciation of nature. She showed him colors in the landscape  that he would never have dreamed were there. He had known only the primary  colors. All colors of red were red. Black was black, and brown was just  plain brown until it became yellow, when it was no longer brown. Purple  he had always imagined was red, something like blood, until she taught  him better. Once they rode out on a high hill brow where wind-blown poppies  blazed about their horses' knees, and she was in an ecstasy over the lines  of the many distances. Seven, she counted, and he, who had gazed on landscapes  all his life, for the first time learned what a ""distance"" was. After that,  and always, he looked upon the face of nature with a more seeing eye, learning  a delight of his own in surveying the serried ranks of the upstanding ranges,  and in slow contemplation of the purple summer mists that haunted the languid  creases of the distant hills.    But through it all ran the golden thread of love. At first he had been  content just to ride with Dede and to be on comradely terms with her; but  the desire and the need for her increased. The more he knew of her, the  higher was his appraisal. Had she been reserved and haughty with him, or  been merely a giggling, simpering creature of a woman, it would have been  different. Instead, she amazed him with her simplicity and wholesomeness,  with her great store of comradeliness. This latter was the unexpected.  He had never looked upon woman in that way. Woman, the toy; woman, the  harpy; woman, the necessary wife and mother of the race's offspring,--all  this had been his expectation and understanding of woman. But woman, the  comrade and playfellow and joyfellow--this was what Dede had surprised  him in. And the more she became worth while, the more ardently his love  burned, unconsciously shading his voice with caresses, and with equal unconsciousness  flaring up signal fires in his eyes. Nor was she blind to it yet, like  many women before her, she thought to play with the pretty fire and escape  the consequent conflagration.    ""Winter will soon be coming on,"" she said regretfully, and with provocation,  one day, ""and then there won't be any more riding.""    ""But I must see you in the winter just the same,"" he cried hastily.    She shook her head.    ""We have been very happy and all that,"" she said, looking at him with  steady frankness. ""I remember your foolish argument for getting acquainted,  too; but it won't lead to anything; it can't. I know myself too well to  be mistaken.""    Her face was serious, even solicitous with desire not to hurt, and her  eyes were unwavering, but in them was the light, golden and glowing--the  abyss of sex into which he was now unafraid to gaze.    ""I've been pretty good,"" he declared. ""I leave it to you if I haven't.  It's been pretty hard, too, I can tell you. You just think it over. Not  once have I said a word about love to you, and me loving you all the time.  That's going some for a man that's used to having his own way. I'm somewhat  of a rusher when it comes to travelling. I reckon I'd rush God Almighty  if it came to a race over the ice. And yet I didn't rush you. I guess this  fact is an indication of how much I do love you. Of course I want you to  marry me. Have I said a word about it, though? Nary a chirp, nary a flutter.  I've been quiet and good, though it's almost made me sick at times, this  keeping quiet. I haven't asked you to marry me. I'm not asking you now.  Oh, not but what you satisfy me. I sure know you're the wife for me. But  how about myself ? Do you know me well enough know your own mind?"" He shrugged  his shoulders. ""I don't know, and I ain't going to take chances on it now.  You've got to know for sure whether you think you could get along with  me or not, and I'm playing a slow conservative game. I ain't a-going to  lose for overlooking my hand.""    This was love-making of a sort beyond Dede's experience. Nor had she  ever heard of anything like it. Furthermore, its lack of ardor carried  with it a shock which she could overcome only by remembering the way his  hand had trembled in the past, and by remembering the passion she had seen  that very day and every day in his eyes, or heard in his voice. Then, too,  she recollected what he had said to her weeks before: ""Maybe you don't  know what patience is,"" he had said, and thereat told her of shooting squirrels  with a big rifle the time he and Elijah Davis had starved on the Stewart  River.    ""So you see,"" he urged, ""just for a square deal we've got to see some  more of each other this winter. Most likely your mind ain't made up yet--""    ""But it is,"" she interrupted. ""I wouldn't dare permit myself to care  for you. Happiness, for me, would not lie that way. I like you, Mr. Harnish,  and all that, but it can never be more than that.""    ""It's because you don't like my way of living,"" he charged, thinking  in his own mind of the sensational joyrides and general profligacy with  which the newspapers had credited him--thinking this, and wondering whether  or not, in maiden modesty, she would disclaim knowledge of it.    To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.    ""No; I don't.""    ""I know I've been brash on some of those rides that got into the papers,""  he began his defense, ""and that I've been travelling with a lively crowd.""    ""I don't mean that,"" she said, ""though I know about it too, and can't  say that I like it. But it is your life in general, your business. There  are women in the world who could marry a man like you and be happy, but  I couldn't. And the more I cared for such a man, the more unhappy I should  be. You see, my unhappiness, in turn, would tend to make him unhappy. I  should make a mistake, and he would make an equal mistake, though his would  not be so hard on him because he would still have his business.""    ""Business!"" Daylight gasped. ""What's wrong with my business? I play  fair and square. There's nothing under hand about it, which can't be said  of most businesses, whether of the big corporations or of the cheating,  lying, little corner-grocerymen. I play the straight rules of the game,  and I don't have to lie or cheat or break my word.""    Dede hailed with relief the change in the conversation and at the same  time the opportunity to speak her mind.    ""In ancient Greece,"" she began pedantically, ""a man was judged a good  citizen who built houses, planted trees--"" She did not complete the quotation,  but drew the conclusion hurriedly. ""How many houses have you built? How  many trees have you planted?""    He shook his head noncommittally, for he had not grasped the drift of  the argument.    ""Well,"" she went on, ""two winters ago you cornered coal--""    ""Just locally,"" he grinned reminiscently, ""just locally. And I took  advantage of the car shortage and the strike in British Columbia.""    ""But you didn't dig any of that coal yourself. Yet you forced it up  four dollars a ton and made a lot of money. That was your business. You  made the poor people pay more for their coal. You played fair, as you said,  but you put your hands down into all their pockets and took their money  away from them. I know. I burn a grate fire in my sitting-room at Berkeley.  And instead of eleven dollars a ton for Rock Wells, I paid fifteen dollars  that winter. You robbed me of four dollars. I could stand it. But there  were thousands of the very poor who could not stand it. You might call  it legal gambling, but to me it was downright robbery.""    Daylight was not abashed. This was no revelation to him. He remembered  the old woman who made wine in the Sonoma hills and the millions like her  who were made to be robbed.    ""Now look here, Miss Mason, you've got me there slightly, I grant. But  you've seen me in business a long time now, and you know I don't make a  practice of raiding the poor people. I go after the big fellows. They're  my meat. They rob the poor, and I rob them. That coal deal was an accident.  I wasn't after the poor people in that, but after the big fellows, and  I got them, too. The poor people happened to get in the way and got hurt,  that was all.    ""Don't you see,"" he went on, ""the whole game is a gamble. Everybody  gambles in one way or another. The farmer gambles against the weather and  the market on his crops. So does the United States Steel Corporation. The  business of lots of men is straight robbery of the poor people. But I've  never made that my business. You know that. I've always gone after the  robbers.""    ""I missed my point,"" she admitted. ""Wait a minute.""    And for a space they rode in silence.    ""I see it more clearly than I can state it, but it's something like  this. There is legitimate work, and there's work that--well, that isn't  legitimate. The farmer works the soil and produces grain. He's making something  that is good for humanity. He actually, in a way, creates something, the  grain that will fill the mouths of the hungry.""    ""And then the railroads and market-riggers and the rest proceed to rob  him of that same grain,""--Daylight broke in Dede smiled and held up her  hand.    ""Wait a minute. You'll make me lose my point. It doesn't hurt if they  rob him of all of it so that he starves to death. The point is that the  wheat he grew is still in the world. It exists. Don't you see? The farmer  created something, say ten tons of wheat, and those ten tons exist. The  railroads haul the wheat to market, to the mouths that will eat it. This  also is legitimate. It's like some one bringing you a glass of water, or  taking a cinder out of your eye. Something has been done, in a way been  created, just like the wheat.""    ""But the railroads rob like Sam Scratch,"" Daylight objected.    ""Then the work they do is partly legitimate and partly not. Now we come  to you. You don't create anything. Nothing new exists when you're done  with your business. Just like the coal. You didn't dig it. You didn't haul  it to market. You didn't deliver it. Don't you see? that's what I meant  by planting the trees and building the houses. You haven't planted one  tree nor built a single house.""    ""I never guessed there was a woman in the world who could talk business  like that,"" he murmured admiringly. ""And you've got me on that point. But  there's a lot to be said on my side just the same. Now you listen to me.  I'm going to talk under three heads. Number one: We live a short time,  the best of us, and we're a long time dead. Life is a big gambling game.  Some are born lucky and some are born unlucky. Everybody sits in at the  table, and everybody tries to rob everybody else. Most of them get robbed.  They're born suckers.    ""Fellow like me comes along and sizes up the proposition. I've got two  choices. I can herd with the suckers, or I can herd with the robbers. As  a sucker, I win nothing. Even the crusts of bread are snatched out of my  mouth by the robbers. I work hard all my days, and die working. And I ain't  never had a flutter. I've had nothing but work, work, work. They talk about  the dignity of labor. I tell you there ain't no dignity in that sort of  labor. My other choice is to herd with the robbers, and I herd with them.  I play that choice wide open to win. I get the automobiles, and the porterhouse  steaks, and the soft beds.    ""Number two: There ain't much difference between playing halfway robber  like the railroad hauling that farmer's wheat to market, and playing all  robber and robbing the robbers like I do. And, besides, halfway robbery  is too slow a game for me to sit in. You don't win quick enough for me.""    ""But what do you want to win for?"" Dede demanded. ""You have millions  and millions, already. You can't ride in more than one automobile at a  time, sleep in more than one bed at a time.""    ""Number three answers that,"" he said, ""and here it is: Men and things  are so made that they have different likes. A rabbit likes a vegetarian  diet. A lynx likes meat. Ducks swim; chickens are scairt of water. One  man collects postage stamps, another man collects butterflies. This man  goes in for paintings, that man goes in for yachts, and some other fellow  for hunting big game. One man thinks horse-racing is It, with a big I,  and another man finds the biggest satisfaction in actresses. They can't  help these likes. They have them, and what are they going to do about it?  Now I like gambling. I like to play the game. I want to play it big and  play it quick. I'm just made that way. And I play it.""    ""But why can't you do good with all your money?""    Daylight laughed.    ""Doing good with your money! It's like slapping God in the face, as  much as to tell him that he don't know how to run his world and that you'll  be much obliged if he'll stand out of the way and give you a chance. Thinking  about God doesn't keep me sitting up nights, so I've got another way of  looking at it. Ain't it funny, to go around with brass knuckles and a big  club breaking folks' heads and taking their money away from them until  I've got a pile, and then, repenting of my ways, going around and bandaging  up the heads the other robbers are breaking? I leave it to you. That's  what doing good with money amounts to. Every once in a while some robber  turns soft-hearted and takes to driving an ambulance. That's what Carnegie  did. He smashed heads in pitched battles at Homestead, regular wholesale  head-breaker he was, held up the suckers for a few hundred million, and  now he goes around dribbling it back to them. funny? I leave it to you.""    He rolled a cigarette and watched her half curiously, half amusedly.  His replies and harsh generalizations of a harsh school were disconcerting,  and she came back to her earlier position.    ""I can't argue with you, and you know that. No matter how right a woman  is, men have such a way about them well, what they say sounds most convincing,  and yet the woman is still certain they are wrong. But there is one thing--the  creative joy. Call it gambling if you will, but just the same it seems  to me more satisfying to create something, make something, than just to  roll dice out of a dice-box all day long. Why, sometimes, for exercise,  or when I've got to pay fifteen dollars for coal, I curry Mab and give  her a whole half hour's brushing. And when I see her coat clean and shining  and satiny, I feel a satisfaction in what I've done. So it must be with  the man who builds a house or plants a tree. He can look at it. He made  it. It's his handiwork. Even if somebody like you comes along and takes  his tree away from him, still it is there, and still did he make it. You  can't rob him of that, Mr. Harnish, with all your millions. It's the creative  joy, and it's a higher joy than mere gambling. Haven't you ever made things  yourself--a log cabin up in the Yukon, or a canoe, or raft, or something?  And don't you remember how satisfied you were, how good you felt, while  you were doing it and after you had it done?""    While she spoke his memory was busy with the associations she recalled.  He saw the deserted flat on the river bank by the Klondike, and he saw  the log cabins and warehouses spring up, and all the log structures he  had built, and his sawmills working night and day on three shifts.    ""Why, dog-gone it, Miss Mason, you're right--in a way. I've built hundreds  of houses up there, and I remember I was proud and glad to see them go  up. I'm proud now, when I remember them. And there was Ophir--the most  God-forsaken moose-pasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on. I made that  into the big Ophir. Why, I ran the water in there from the Rinkabilly,  eighty miles away. They all said I couldn't, but I did it, and I did it  by myself. The dam and the flume cost me four million. But you should have  seen that Ophir--power plants, electric lights, and hundreds of men on  the pay-roll, working night and day. I guess I do get an inkling of what  you mean by making a thing. I made Ophir, and by God, she was a sure hummer--I  beg your pardon. I didn't mean to cuss. But that Ophir !--I sure am proud  of her now, just as the last time I laid eyes on her.""    ""And you won something there that was more than mere money,"" Dede encouraged.  ""Now do you know what I would do if I had lots of money and simply had  to go on playing at business? Take all the southerly and westerly slopes  of these bare hills. I'd buy them in and plant eucalyptus on them. I'd  do it for the joy of doing it anyway; but suppose I had that gambling twist  in me which you talk about, why, I'd do it just the same and make money  out of the trees. And there's my other point again. Instead of raising  the price of coal without adding an ounce of coal to the market supply,  I'd be making thousands and thousands of cords of firewood--making something  where nothing was before. And everybody who ever crossed on the ferries  would look up at these forested hills and be made glad. Who was made glad  by your adding four dollars a ton to Rock Wells?""    It was Daylight's turn to be silent for a time while she waited an answer.    ""Would you rather I did things like that?"" he asked at last.    ""It would be better for the world, and better for you,"" she answered  noncommittally.         "
20,A Journal Of The Plague Year,51,Daniel Defoe,Part3,"CHAPTER XI                Martin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been    finished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by    his attempts to write poetry.  His poems were love poems, inspired    by Ruth, but they were never completed.  Not in a day could he    learn to chant in noble verse.  Rhyme and metre and structure were    serious enough in themselves, but there was, over and beyond them,    an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great    poetry, but which he could not catch and imprison in his own.  It    was the elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought    after but could not capture.  It seemed a glow to him, a warm and    trailing vapor, ever beyond his reaching, though sometimes he was    rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving them into phrases    that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his    vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty.  It was baffling.  He    ached with desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as    everybody gibbered.  He read his fragments aloud.  The metre    marched along on perfect feet, and the rhyme pounded a longer and    equally faultless rhythm, but the glow and high exaltation that he    felt within were lacking.  He could not understand, and time and    again, in despair, defeated and depressed, he returned to his    article.  Prose was certainly an easier medium.        Following the ""Pearl-diving,"" he wrote an article on the sea as a    career, another on turtle-catching, and a third on the northeast    trades.  Then he tried, as an experiment, a short story, and before    he broke his stride he had finished six short stories and    despatched them to various magazines.  He wrote prolifically,    intensely, from morning till night, and late at night, except when    he broke off to go to the reading-room, draw books from the    library, or to call on Ruth.  He was profoundly happy.  Life was    pitched high.  He was in a fever that never broke.  The joy of    creation that is supposed to belong to the gods was his.  All the    life about him - the odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds, the    slatternly form of his sister, and the jeering face of Mr.    Higginbotham - was a dream.  The real world was in his mind, and    the stories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his    mind.        The days were too short.  There was so much he wanted to study.  He    cut his sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along    upon it.  He tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came back    to five.  He could joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon    any one of his pursuits.  It was with regret that he ceased from    writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the library,    that he tore himself away from that chart-room of knowledge or from    the magazines in the reading-room that were filled with the secrets    of writers who succeeded in selling their wares.  It was like    severing heart strings, when he was with Ruth, to stand up and go;    and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his    books at the least possible expense of time.  And hardest of all    was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put note-book and pencil    aside, and close his tired eyes in sleep.  He hated the thought of    ceasing to live, even for so short a time, and his sole consolation    was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead.  He would lose    only five hours anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him    out of unconsciousness and he would have before him another    glorious day of nineteen hours.        In the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low,    and there was no money coming in.  A month after he had mailed it,    the adventure serial for boys was returned to him by THE YOUTH'S    COMPANION.  The rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt    kindly toward the editor.  But he did not feel so kindly toward the    editor of the SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER.  After waiting two whole    weeks, Martin had written to him.  A week later he wrote again.  At    the end of the month, he went over to San Francisco and personally    called upon the editor.  But he did not meet that exalted    personage, thanks to a Cerberus of an office boy, of tender years    and red hair, who guarded the portals.  At the end of the fifth    week the manuscript came back to him, by mail, without comment.    There was no rejection slip, no explanation, nothing.  In the same    way his other articles were tied up with the other leading San    Francisco papers.  When he recovered them, he sent them to the    magazines in the East, from which they were returned more promptly,    accompanied always by the printed rejection slips.        The short stories were returned in similar fashion.  He read them    over and over, and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out    the cause of their rejection, until, one day, he read in a    newspaper that manuscripts should always be typewritten.  That    explained it.  Of course editors were so busy that they could not    afford the time and strain of reading handwriting.  Martin rented a    typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine.  Each day he    typed what he composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as    fast as they were returned him.  He was surprised when the typed    ones began to come back.  His jaw seemed to become squarer, his    chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts off to new    editors.        The thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own    work.  He tried it out on Gertrude.  He read his stories aloud to    her.  Her eyes glistened, and she looked at him proudly as she    said:-        ""Ain't it grand, you writin' those sort of things.""        ""Yes, yes,"" he demanded impatiently.  ""But the story - how did you    like it?""        ""Just grand,"" was the reply.  ""Just grand, an' thrilling, too.  I    was all worked up.""        He could see that her mind was not clear.  The perplexity was    strong in her good-natured face.  So he waited.        ""But, say, Mart,"" after a long pause, ""how did it end?  Did that    young man who spoke so highfalutin' get her?""        And, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made    artistically obvious, she would say:-        ""That's what I wanted to know.  Why didn't you write that way in    the story?""        One thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories,    namely, that she liked happy endings.        ""That story was perfectly grand,"" she announced, straightening up    from the wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her    forehead with a red, steamy hand; ""but it makes me sad.  I want to    cry.  There is too many sad things in the world anyway.  It makes    me happy to think about happy things.  Now if he'd married her, and    - You don't mind, Mart?"" she queried apprehensively.  ""I just    happen to feel that way, because I'm tired, I guess.  But the story    was grand just the same, perfectly grand.  Where are you goin' to    sell it?""        ""That's a horse of another color,"" he laughed.        ""But if you DID sell it, what do you think you'd get for it?""        ""Oh, a hundred dollars.  That would be the least, the way prices    go.""        ""My!  I do hope you'll sell it!""        ""Easy money, eh?""  Then he added proudly:  ""I wrote it in two days.    That's fifty dollars a day.""        He longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare.  He would    wait till some were published, he decided, then she would    understand what he had been working for.  In the meantime he toiled    on.  Never had the spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than    on this amazing exploration of the realm of mind.  He bought the    text-books on physics and chemistry, and, along with his algebra,    worked out problems and demonstrations.  He took the laboratory    proofs on faith, and his intense power of vision enabled him to see    the reactions of chemicals more understandingly than the average    student saw them in the laboratory.  Martin wandered on through the    heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he was getting to the nature    of things.  He had accepted the world as the world, but now he was    comprehending the organization of it, the play and interplay of    force and matter.  Spontaneous explanations of old matters were    continually arising in his mind.  Levers and purchases fascinated    him, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes and blocks and    tackles at sea.  The theory of navigation, which enabled the ships    to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean, was    made clear to him.  The mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were    revealed, and the reason for the existence of trade-winds made him    wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade    too soon.  At any rate he knew he could write it better now.  One    afternoon he went out with Arthur to the University of California,    and, with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe, went through    the laboratories, saw demonstrations, and listened to a physics    professor lecturing to his classes.        But he did not neglect his writing.  A stream of short stories    flowed from his pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of    verse - the kind he saw printed in the magazines - though he lost    his head and wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the    swift rejection of which, by half a dozen magazines, dumfounded    him.  Then he discovered Henley and wrote a series of sea-poems on    the model of ""Hospital Sketches.""  They were simple poems, of light    and color, and romance and adventure.  ""Sea Lyrics,"" he called    them, and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done.    There were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing one a    day after having done his regular day's work on fiction, which    day's work was the equivalent to a week's work of the average    successful writer.  The toil meant nothing to him.  It was not    toil.  He was finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that    had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was now    pouring forth in a wild and virile flood.        He showed the ""Sea Lyrics"" to no one, not even to the editors.  He    had become distrustful of editors.  But it was not distrust that    prevented him from submitting the ""Lyrics.""  They were so beautiful    to him that he was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some    glorious, far-off time when he would dare to read to her what he    had written.  Against that time he kept them with him, reading them    aloud, going over them until he knew them by heart.        He lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his    sleep, his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of    surcease and combining the thoughts and events of the day into    grotesque and impossible marvels.  In reality, he never rested, and    a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would have been    prostrated in a general break-down.  His late afternoon calls on    Ruth were rarer now, for June was approaching, when she would take    her degree and finish with the university.  Bachelor of Arts! -    when he thought of her degree, it seemed she fled beyond him faster    than he could pursue.        One afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually    stayed for dinner and for music afterward.  Those were his red-    letter days.  The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with    that in which he lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him    forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the    heights.  In spite of the beauty in him, and the aching desire to    create, it was for her that he struggled.  He was a lover first and    always.  All other things he subordinated to love.        Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his love-    adventure.  The world itself was not so amazing because of the    atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions    of irresistible force; what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth    lived in it.  She was the most amazing thing he had ever known, or    dreamed, or guessed.        But he was oppressed always by her remoteness.  She was so far from    him, and he did not know how to approach her.  He had been a    success with girls and women in his own class; but he had never    loved any of them, while he did love her, and besides, she was not    merely of another class.  His very love elevated her above all    classes.  She was a being apart, so far apart that he did not know    how to draw near to her as a lover should draw near.  It was true,    as he acquired knowledge and language, that he was drawing nearer,    talking her speech, discovering ideas and delights in common; but    this did not satisfy his lover's yearning.  His lover's imagination    had made her holy, too holy, too spiritualized, to have any kinship    with him in the flesh.  It was his own love that thrust her from    him and made her seem impossible for him.  Love itself denied him    the one thing that it desired.        And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was    bridged for a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it    was ever narrower.  They had been eating cherries - great,    luscious, black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine.    And later, as she read aloud to him from ""The Princess,"" he chanced    to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.  For the moment    her divinity was shattered.  She was clay, after all, mere clay,    subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject, or    anybody's clay.  Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries dyed    them as cherries dyed his.  And if so with her lips, then was it so    with all of her.  She was woman, all woman, just like any woman.    It came upon him abruptly.  It was a revelation that stunned him.    It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen    worshipped purity polluted.        Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began    pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who    was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a    cherry could stain.  He trembled at the audacity of his thought;    but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean,    assured him he was right.  Something of this change in him must    have reached her, for she paused from her reading, looked up at    him, and smiled.  His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips,    and the sight of the stain maddened him.  His arms all but flashed    out to her and around her, in the way of his old careless life.    She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will fought to    hold him back.        ""You were not following a word,"" she pouted.        Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he    looked into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of    what he felt, he became abashed.  He had indeed in thought dared    too far.  Of all the women he had known there was no woman who    would not have guessed - save her.  And she had not guessed.  There    was the difference.  She was different.  He was appalled by his own    grossness, awed by her clear innocence, and he gazed again at her    across the gulf.  The bridge had broken down.        But still the incident had brought him nearer.  The memory of it    persisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt    upon it eagerly.  The gulf was never again so wide.  He had    accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts,    or a dozen bachelorships.  She was pure, it was true, as he had    never dreamed of purity; but cherries stained her lips.  She was    subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was.    She had to eat to live, and when she got her feet wet, she caught    cold.  But that was not the point.  If she could feel hunger and    thirst, and heat and cold, then could she feel love - and love for    a man.  Well, he was a man.  And why could he not be the man?    ""It's up to me to make good,"" he would murmur fervently.  ""I will    be THE man.  I will make myself THE man.  I will make good.""    "
51,Adam Bede,101,George Eliot,Book5-chapter39,"Women In Love: Chapter 11        CHAPTER XI An Island MEANWHILE Ursula had wandered on from Willey Water  along the course of the bright little stream. The afternoon was full of  larks' singing. On the bright hill-sides was a subdued smoulder of gorse.  A few forget-me-nots flowered by the water. There was a rousedness and  a glancing everywhere.    She strayed absorbedly on, over the brooks. She wanted to go to the  mill-pond above. The big mill-house was deserted, save for a labourer and  his wife who lived in the kitchen. So she passed through the empty farm-yard  and through the wilderness of a garden, and mounted the bank by the sluice.  When she got to the top, to see the old, velvety surface of the pond before  her, she noticed a man on the bank, tinkering with a punt. It was Birkin  sawing and hammering away.    She stood at the head of the sluice, looking at him. He was unaware  of anybody's presence. He looked very busy, like a wild animal, active  and intent. She felt she ought to go away, he would not want her. He seemed  to be so much occupied. But she did not want to go away. Therefore she  moved along the bank till he would look up.    Which he soon did. The moment he saw her, he dropped his tools and came  forward, saying:    `How do you do? I'm making the punt water-tight. Tell me if you think  it is right.'    She went along with him.    `You are your father's daughter, so you can tell me if it will do,'  he said.    She bent to look at the patched punt.    `I am sure I am my father's daughter,' she said, fearful of having to  judge. `But I don't know anything about carpentry. It looks right,  don't you think?'    `Yes, I think. I hope it won't let me to the bottom, that's all. Though  even so, it isn't a great matter, I should come up again. Help me to get  it into the water, will you?'    With combined efforts they turned over the heavy punt and set it afloat.    `Now,' he said, `I'll try it and you can watch what happens. Then if  it carries, I'll take you over to the island.'    `Do,' she cried, watching anxiously.    The pond was large, and had that perfect stillness and the dark lustre  of very deep water. There were two small islands overgrown with bushes  and a few trees, towards the middle. Birkin pushed himself off, and veered  clumsily in the pond. Luckily the punt drifted so that he could catch hold  of a willow bough, and pull it to the island.    `Rather overgrown,' he said, looking into the interior, `but very nice.  I'll come and fetch you. The boat leaks a little.'    In a moment he was with her again, and she stepped into the wet punt.    `It'll float us all right,' he said, and manoeuvred again to the island.    They landed under a willow tree. She shrank from the little jungle of  rank plants before her, evil-smelling figwort and hemlock. But he explored  into it.    `I shall mow this down,' he said, `and then it will be romantic -- like  Paul et Virginie.'    `Yes, one could have lovely Watteau picnics here,' cried Ursula with  enthusiasm.    His face darkened.    `I don't want Watteau picnics here,' he said.    `Only your Virginie,' she laughed.    `Virginie enough,' he smiled wryly. `No, I don't want her either.'    Ursula looked at him closely. She had not seen him since Breadalby.  He was very thin and hollow, with a ghastly look in his face.    `You have been ill; haven't you?' she asked, rather repulsed.    `Yes,' he replied coldly.    They had sat down under the willow tree, and were looking at the pond,  from their retreat on the island.    `Has it made you frightened?' she asked.    `What of?' he asked, turning his eyes to look at her. Something in him,  inhuman and unmitigated, disturbed her, and shook her out of her ordinary  self.    `It is frightening to be very ill, isn't it?' she said.    `It isn't pleasant,' he said. `Whether one is really afraid of death,  or not, I have never decided. In one mood, not a bit, in another, very  much.'    `But doesn't it make you feel ashamed? I think it makes one so ashamed,  to be ill -- illness is so terribly humiliating, don't you think?'    He considered for some minutes.    `May-be,' he said. `Though one knows all the time one's life isn't really  right, at the source. That's the humiliation. I don't see that the illness  counts so much, after that. One is ill because one doesn't live properly  -- can't. It's the failure to live that makes one ill, and humiliates one.'    `But do you fail to live?' she asked, almost jeering.    `Why yes -- I don't make much of a success of my days. One seems always  to be bumping one's nose against the blank wall ahead.'    Ursula laughed. She was frightened, and when she was frightened she  always laughed and pretended to be jaunty.    `Your poor nose!' she said, looking at that feature of his face.    `No wonder it's ugly,' he replied.    She was silent for some minutes, struggling with her own self-deception.  It was an instinct in her, to deceive herself.    `But I'm happy -- I think life is awfully jolly,' she  said.    `Good,' he answered, with a certain cold indifference.    She reached for a bit of paper which had wrapped a small piece of chocolate  she had found in her pocket, and began making a boat. He watched her without  heeding her. There was something strangely pathetic and tender in her moving,  unconscious finger-tips, that were agitated and hurt, really.    `I do enjoy things -- don't you?' she asked.    `Oh yes! But it infuriates me that I can't get right, at the really  growing part of me. I feel all tangled and messed up, and I can't  get straight anyhow. I don't know what really to do. One must do  something somewhere.'    `Why should you always be doing?' she retorted. `It is so plebeian.  I think it is much better to be really patrician, and to do nothing but  just be oneself, like a walking flower.'    `I quite agree,' he said, `if one has burst into blossom. But I can't  get my flower to blossom anyhow. Either it is blighted in the bud, or has  got the smother-fly, or it isn't nourished. Curse it, it isn't even a bud.  It is a contravened knot.'    Again she laughed. He was so very fretful and exasperated. But she was  anxious and puzzled. How was one to get out, anyhow. There must be a way  out somewhere.    There was a silence, wherein she wanted to cry. She reached for another  bit of chocolate paper, and began to fold another boat.    `And why is it,' she asked at length, `that there is no flowering, no  dignity of human life now?'    `The whole idea is dead. Humanity itself is dry-rotten, really. There  are myriads of human beings hanging on the bush -- and they look very nice  and rosy, your healthy young men and women. But they are apples of Sodom,  as a matter of fact, Dead Sea Fruit, gall-apples. It isn't true that they  have any significance -- their insides are full of bitter, corrupt ash.'    `But there are good people,' protested Ursula.    `Good enough for the life of today. But mankind is a dead tree, covered  with fine brilliant galls of people.'    Ursula could not help stiffening herself against this, it was too picturesque  and final. But neither could she help making him go on.    `And if it is so, why is it?' she asked, hostile. They were rousing  each other to a fine passion of opposition.    `Why, why are people all balls of bitter dust? Because they won't fall  off the tree when they're ripe. They hang on to their old positions when  the position is over-past, till they become infested with little worms  and dry-rot.'    There was a long pause. His voice had become hot and very sarcastic.  Ursula was troubled and bewildered, they were both oblivious of everything  but their own immersion.    `But even if everybody is wrong -- where are you right?' she cried,  `where are you any better?'    `I? -- I'm not right,' he cried back. `At least my only rightness lies  in the fact that I know it. I detest what I am, outwardly. I loathe myself  as a human being. Humanity is a huge aggregate lie, and a huge lie is less  than a small truth. Humanity is less, far less than the individual, because  the individual may sometimes be capable of truth, and humanity is a tree  of lies. And they say that love is the greatest thing; they persist in  saying this, the foul liars, and just look at what they do! Look  at all the millions of people who repeat every minute that love is the  greatest, and charity is the greatest -- and see what they are doing all  the time. By their works ye shall know them, for dirty liars and cowards,  who daren't stand by their own actions, much less by their own words.'    `But,' said Ursula sadly, `that doesn't alter the fact that love is  the greatest, does it? What they do doesn't alter the truth of what  they say, does it?'    `Completely, because if what they say were true, then they couldn't  help fulfilling it. But they maintain a lie, and so they run amok at last.  It's a lie to say that love is the greatest. You might as well say that  hate is the greatest, since the opposite of everything balances. What people  want is hate -- hate and nothing but hate. And in the name of righteousness  and love, they get it. They distil themselves with nitroglycerine, all  the lot of them, out of very love. It's the lie that kills. If we want  hate, let us have it -- death, murder, torture, violent destruction --  let us have it: but not in the name of love. But I abhor humanity, I wish  it was swept away. It could go, and there would be no absolute loss,  if every human being perished tomorrow. The reality would be untouched.  Nay, it would be better. The real tree of life would then be rid of the  most ghastly, heavy crop of Dead Sea Fruit, the intolerable burden of myriad  simulacra of people, an infinite weight of mortal lies.'    `So you'd like everybody in the world destroyed?' said Ursula.    `I should indeed.'    `And the world empty of people?'    `Yes truly. You yourself, don't you find it a beautiful clean thought,  a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?'    The pleasant sincerity of his voice made Ursula pause to consider her  own proposition. And really it was attractive: a clean, lovely,  humanless world. It was the really desirable. Her heart hesitated,  and exulted. But still, she was dissatisfied with him.    `But,' she objected, `you'd be dead yourself, so what good would it  do you?'    `I would die like a shot, to know that the earth would really be cleaned  of all the people. It is the most beautiful and freeing thought. Then there  would never be another foul humanity created, for a universal defilement.'    `No,' said Ursula, `there would be nothing.'    `What! Nothing? Just because humanity was wiped out? You flatter yourself.  There'd be everything.'    `But how, if there were no people?'    `Do you think that creation depends on man! It merely doesn't.  There are the trees and the grass and birds. I much prefer to think of  the lark rising up in the morning upon a human-less world. Man is a mistake,  he must go. There is the grass, and hares and adders, and the unseen hosts,  actual angels that go about freely when a dirty humanity doesn't interrupt  them -- and good pure-tissued demons: very nice.'    It pleased Ursula, what he said, pleased her very much, as a phantasy.  Of course it was only a pleasant fancy. She herself knew too well the actuality  of humanity, its hideous actuality. She knew it could not disappear so  cleanly and conveniently. It had a long way to go yet, a long and hideous  way. Her subtle, feminine, demoniacal soul knew it well.    `If only man was swept off the face of the earth, creation would go  on so marvellously, with a new start, non-human. Man is one of the mistakes  of creation -- like the ichthyosauri. If only he were gone again, think  what lovely things would come out of the liberated days; -- things straight  out of the fire.'    `But man will never be gone,' she said, with insidious, diabolical knowledge  of the horrors of persistence. `The world will go with him.'    `Ah no,' he answered, `not so. I believe in the proud angels and the  demons that are our fore-runners. They will destroy us, because we are  not proud enough. The ichthyosauri were not proud: they crawled and floundered  as we do. And besides, look at elder-flowers and bluebells -- they are  a sign that pure creation takes place -- even the butterfly. But humanity  never gets beyond the caterpillar stage -- it rots in the chrysalis, it  never will have wings. It is anti-creation, like monkeys and baboons.'    Ursula watched him as he talked. There seemed a certain impatient fury  in him, all the while, and at the same time a great amusement in everything,  and a final tolerance. And it was this tolerance she mistrusted, not the  fury. She saw that, all the while, in spite of himself, he would have to  be trying to save the world. And this knowledge, whilst it comforted her  heart somewhere with a little self-satisfaction, stability, yet filled  her with a certain sharp contempt and hate of him. She wanted him to herself,  she hated the Salvator Mundi touch. It was something diffuse and generalised  about him, which she could not stand. He would behave in the same way,  say the same things, give himself as completely to anybody who came along,  anybody and everybody who liked to appeal to him. It was despicable, a  very insidious form of prostitution.    `But,' she said, `you believe in individual love, even if you don't  believe in loving humanity --?'    `I don't believe in love at all -- that is, any more than I believe  in hate, or in grief. Love is one of the emotions like all the others --  and so it is all right whilst you feel it But I can't see how it becomes  an absolute. It is just part of human relationships, no more. And it is  only part of any human relationship. And why one should be required  always to feel it, any more than one always feels sorrow or distant  joy, I cannot conceive. Love isn't a desideratum -- it is an emotion you  feel or you don't feel, according to circumstance.'    `Then why do you care about people at all?' she asked, `if you don't  believe in love? Why do you bother about humanity?'    `Why do I? Because I can't get away from it.'    `Because you love it,' she persisted.    It irritated him.    `If I do love it,' he said, `it is my disease.'    `But it is a disease you don't want to be cured of,' she said, with  some cold sneering.    He was silent now, feeling she wanted to insult him.    `And if you don't believe in love, what do you believe in?' she  asked mocking. `Simply in the end of the world, and grass?'    He was beginning to feel a fool.    `I believe in the unseen hosts,' he said.    `And nothing else? You believe in nothing visible, except grass and  birds? Your world is a poor show.'    `Perhaps it is,' he said, cool and superior now he was offended, assuming  a certain insufferable aloof superiority, and withdrawing into his distance.    Ursula disliked him. But also she felt she had lost something. She looked  at him as he sat crouched on the bank. There was a certain priggish Sunday-school  stiffness over him, priggish and detestable. And yet, at the same time,  the moulding of him was so quick and attractive, it gave such a great sense  of freedom: the moulding of his brows, his chin, his whole physique, something  so alive, somewhere, in spite of the look of sickness.    And it was this duality in feeling which he created in her, that made  a fine hate of him quicken in her bowels. There was his wonderful, desirable  life-rapidity, the rare quality of an utterly desirable man: and there  was at the same time this ridiculous, mean effacement into a Salvator Mundi  and a Sunday-school teacher, a prig of the stiffest type.    He looked up at her. He saw her face strangely enkindled, as if suffused  from within by a powerful sweet fire. His soul was arrested in wonder.  She was enkindled in her own living fire. Arrested in wonder and in pure,  perfect attraction, he moved towards her. She sat like a strange queen,  almost supernatural in her glowing smiling richness.    `The point about love,' he said, his consciousness quickly adjusting  itself, `is that we hate the word because we have vulgarised it. It ought  to be prescribed, tabooed from utterance, for many years, till we get a  new, better idea.'    There was a beam of understanding between them.    `But it always means the same thing,' she said.    `Ah God, no, let it not mean that any more,' he cried. `Let the old  meanings go.'    `But still it is love,' she persisted. A strange, wicked yellow light  shone at him in her eyes.    He hesitated, baffled, withdrawing.    `No,' he said, `it isn't. Spoken like that, never in the world. You've  no business to utter the word.'    `I must leave it to you, to take it out of the Ark of the Covenant at  the right moment,' she mocked.    Again they looked at each other. She suddenly sprang up, turned her  back to him, and walked away. He too rose slowly and went to the water's  edge, where, crouching, he began to amuse himself unconsciously. Picking  a daisy he dropped it on the pond, so that the stem was a keel, the flower  floated like a little water lily, staring with its open face up to the  sky. It turned slowly round, in a slow, slow Dervish dance, as it veered  away.    He watched it, then dropped another daisy into the water, and after  that another, and sat watching them with bright, absolved eyes, crouching  near on the bank. Ursula turned to look. A strange feeling possessed her,  as if something were taking place. But it was all intangible. And some  sort of control was being put on her. She could not know. She could only  watch the brilliant little discs of the daisies veering slowly in travel  on the dark, lustrous water. The little flotilla was drifting into the  light, a company of white specks in the distance.    `Do let us go to the shore, to follow them,' she said, afraid of being  any longer imprisoned on the island. And they pushed off in the punt.    She was glad to be on the free land again. She went along the bank towards  the sluice. The daisies were scattered broadcast on the pond, tiny radiant  things, like an exaltation, points of exaltation here and there. Why did  they move her so strongly and mystically?    `Look,' he said, `your boat of purple paper is escorting them, and they  are a convoy of rafts.'    Some of the daisies came slowly towards her, hesitating, making a shy  bright little cotillion on the dark clear water. Their gay bright candour  moved her so much as they came near, that she was almost in tears.    `Why are they so lovely,' she cried. `Why do I think them so lovely?'    `They are nice flowers,' he said, her emotional tones putting a constraint  on him.    `You know that a daisy is a company of florets, a concourse, become  individual. Don't the botanists put it highest in the line of development?  I believe they do.'    `The compositae, yes, I think so,' said Ursula, who was never very sure  of anything. Things she knew perfectly well, at one moment, seemed to become  doubtful the next.    `Explain it so, then,' he said. `The daisy is a perfect little democracy,  so it's the highest of flowers, hence its charm.'    `No,' she cried, `no -- never. It isn't democratic.'    `No,' he admitted. `It's the golden mob of the proletariat, surrounded  by a showy white fence of the idle rich.'    `How hateful -- your hateful social orders!' she cried.    `Quite! It's a daisy -- we'll leave it alone.'    `Do. Let it be a dark horse for once,' she said: `if anything can be  a dark horse to you,' she added satirically.    They stood aside, forgetful. As if a little stunned, they both were  motionless, barely conscious. The little conflict into which they had fallen  had torn their consciousness and left them like two impersonal forces,  there in contact.    He became aware of the lapse. He wanted to say something, to get on  to a new more ordinary footing.    `You know,' he said, `that I am having rooms here at the mill? Don't  you think we can have some good times?'    `Oh are you?' she said, ignoring all his implication of admitted intimacy.    He adjusted himself at once, became normally distant.    `If I find I can live sufficiently by myself,' he continued, `I shall  give up my work altogether. It has become dead to me. I don't believe in  the humanity I pretend to be part of, I don't care a straw for the social  ideals I live by, I hate the dying organic form of social mankind -- so  it can't be anything but trumpery, to work at education. I shall drop it  as soon as I am clear enough -- tomorrow perhaps -- and be by myself.'    `Have you enough to live on?' asked Ursula.    `Yes -- I've about four hundred a year. That makes it easy for me.'    There was a pause.    `And what about Hermione?' asked Ursula.    `That's over, finally -- a pure failure, and never could have been anything  else.'    `But you still know each other?'    `We could hardly pretend to be strangers, could we?'    There was a stubborn pause.    `But isn't that a half-measure?' asked Ursula at length.    `I don't think so,' he said. `You'll be able to tell me if it is.'    Again there was a pause of some minutes' duration. He was thinking.    `One must throw everything away, everything -- let everything go, to  get the one last thing one wants,' he said.    `What thing?' she asked in challenge.    `I don't know -- freedom together,' he said.    She had wanted him to say `love.'    There was heard a loud barking of the dogs below. He seemed disturbed  by it. She did not notice. Only she thought he seemed uneasy.    `As a matter of fact,' he said, in rather a small voice, `I believe  that is Hermione come now, with Gerald Crich. She wanted to see the rooms  before they are furnished.'    `I know,' said Ursula. `She will superintend the furnishing for you.'    `Probably. Does it matter?'    `Oh no, I should think not,' said Ursula. `Though personally, I can't  bear her. I think she is a lie, if you like, you who are always talking  about lies.' Then she ruminated for a moment, when she broke out: `Yes,  and I do mind if she furnishes your rooms -- I do mind. I mind that you  keep her hanging on at all.'    He was silent now, frowning.    `Perhaps,' he said. `I don't want her to furnish the rooms here  -- and I don't keep her hanging on. Only, I needn't be churlish to her,  need I? At any rate, I shall have to go down and see them now. You'll come,  won't you?'    `I don't think so,' she said coldly and irresolutely.    `Won't you? Yes do. Come and see the rooms as well. Do come.'           "
57,Agnes Grey,20,Anne Bronte,Chapter15,"V. THE MAN WHO HAD NOWHERE TO GO.            IN the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery,    and I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue    of tumultuous dreams,--dreams of guns and howling mobs,--and became    sensible of a hoarse shouting above me.  I rubbed my eyes and lay    listening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts.    Then came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects    being thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains.    I heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round,    and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round    window and left it streaming.  I jumped into my clothes and went    on deck.        As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky--for the sun    was just rising--the broad back and red hair of the captain,    and over his shoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on    to the mizzen spanker-boom.        The poor brute seemed horribly scared, and crouched in the bottom    of its little cage.        ""Overboard with 'em!"" bawled the captain.  ""Overboard with 'em!    We'll have a clean ship soon of the whole bilin' of 'em.""        He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to tap his shoulder    to come on deck.  He came round with a start, and staggered back    a few paces to stare at me.  It needed no expert eye to tell    that the man was still drunk.        ""Hullo!"" said he, stupidly; and then with a light coming into his eyes,    ""Why, it's Mister--Mister?""        ""Prendick,"" said I.        ""Pendick be damned!"" said he.  ""Shut-up,--that's your name.    Mister Shut-up.""        It was no good answering the brute; but I certainly did not expect    his next move.  He held out his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery    stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in dirty-blue flannels,    who had apparently just come aboard.        ""That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!"" roared the captain.        Montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke.        ""What do you mean?""  I said.        ""That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,--that's what I mean!    Overboard, Mister Shut-up,--and sharp!  We're cleaning the ship out,--    cleaning the whole blessed ship out; and overboard you go!""        I stared at him dumfounded.  Then it occurred to me that it was    exactly the thing I wanted.  The lost prospect of a journey as sole    passenger with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over.    I turned towards Montgomery.        ""Can't have you,"" said Montgomery's companion, concisely.        ""You can't have me!"" said I, aghast.  He had the squarest and most    resolute face I ever set eyes upon.        ""Look here,"" I began, turning to the captain.        ""Overboard!"" said the captain.  ""This ship aint for beasts    and cannibals and worse than beasts, any more.  Overboard you go,    Mister Shut-up. If they can't have you, you goes overboard.    But, anyhow, you go--with your friends.  I've done with this blessed    island for evermore, amen!  I've had enough of it.""        ""But, Montgomery,"" I appealed.        He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at    the grey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me.        ""I'll see to you, presently,"" said the captain.        Then began a curious three-cornered altercation.    Alternately I appealed to one and another of the three men,--    first to the grey-haired man to let me land, and then to the drunken    captain to keep me aboard.  I even bawled entreaties to the sailors.    Montgomery said never a word, only shook his head.    ""You're going overboard, I tell you,"" was the captain's refrain.    ""Law be damned!  I'm king here.""  At last I must confess    my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat.    I felt a gust of hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally    at nothing.        Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of    unshipping the packages and caged animals.  A large launch,    with two standing lugs, lay under the lea of the schooner;    and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung.    I did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving    the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from me    by the side of the schooner.  Neither Montgomery nor his companion    took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting    and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods.    The captain went forward interfering rather than assisting.    I was alternately despairful and desperate.  Once or twice    as I stood waiting there for things to accomplish themselves,    I could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary.    I felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast.    Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man.    I perceived pretty clearly that I had not the stamina    either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,    or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion.    So I waited passively upon fate; and the work of transferring    Montgomery's possessions to the launch went on as if I did    not exist.        Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle.    I was hauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway.    Even then I noticed the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were    with Montgomery in the launch; but the launch was now fully laden,    and was shoved off hastily.  A broadening gap of green water    appeared under me, and I pushed back with all my strength to avoid    falling headlong.  The hands in the launch shouted derisively,    and I heard Montgomery curse at them; and then the captain,    the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran me aft towards    the stern.        The dingey of the ""Lady Vain"" had been towing behind; it was    half full of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled.    I refused to go aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck.    In the end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they had no    stern ladder), and then they cut me adrift.  I drifted slowly    from the schooner.  In a kind of stupor I watched all hands take    to the rigging, and slowly but surely she came round to the wind;    the sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind came into them.    I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling steeply towards me;    and then she passed out of my range of view.        I did not turn my head to follow her.  At first I could scarcely    believe what had happened.  I crouched in the bottom of the dingey,    stunned, and staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea.  Then I realized    that I was in that little hell of mine again, now half swamped;    and looking back over the gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away    from me, with the red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail,    and turning towards the island saw the launch growing smaller as she    approached the beach.        Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me.    I had no means of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there.    I was still weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat;    I was empty and very faint, or I should have had more heart.    But as it was I suddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done    since I was a little child.  The tears ran down my face.  In a passion    of despair I struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat,    and kicked savagely at the gunwale.  I prayed aloud for God to let    me die.    "
75,An Essay On The History Of Civil Society,0,Adam Ferguson,Index,"BOOK VII.        TWO TEMPTATIONS.                CHAPTER LXIII.            These little things are great to little man.--GOLDSMITH.            ""Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?""    said Mr. Toller at one of his Christmas dinner-parties, speaking    to Mr. Farebrother on his right hand.        ""Not much, I am sorry to say,"" answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry    Mr. Toller's banter about his belief in the new medical light.     ""I am out of the way and he is too busy.""        ""Is he?  I am glad to hear it,"" said Dr. Minchin, with mingled    suavity and surprise.        ""He gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital,"" said Mr. Farebrother,    who had his reasons for continuing the subject:  ""I hear of that from    my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often.  She says Lydgate    is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode's institution.     He is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming to us.""        ""And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients,    I suppose,"" said Mr. Toller.        ""Come, Toller, be candid,"" said Mr. Farebrother.  ""You are too clever    not to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in    everything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very    sure what you ought to do.  If a man goes a little too far along    a new road, it is usually himself that he harms more than any one else.""        ""I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him,"" said Dr. Minchin,    looking towards Toller, ""for he has sent you the cream of Peacock's patients.""         ""Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner,""    said Mr. Harry Toller, the brewer.  ""I suppose his relations in the    North back him up.""        ""I hope so,"" said Mr. Chichely, ""else he ought not to have married    that nice girl we were all so fond of.  Hang it, one has a grudge    against a man who carries off the prettiest girl in the town.""        ""Ay, by God! and the best too,"" said Mr. Standish.        ""My friend Vincy didn't half like the marriage, I know that,""    said Mr. Chichely.  ""HE wouldn't do much.  How the relations    on the other side may have come down I can't say.""  There was an    emphatic kind of reticence in Mr. Chichely's manner of speaking.        ""Oh, I shouldn't think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living,""    said Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject    was dropped.        This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of    Lydgate's expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice,    but he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or expectations    which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate's marriage,    and which might hinder any bad consequences from the disappointment    in his practice.  One evening, when he took the pains to go    to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old,    he noticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy    way of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever    he had anything to say.  Lydgate talked persistently when they were    in his work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability    of certain biological views; but he had none of those definite    things to say or to show which give the waymarks of a patient    uninterrupted pursuit, such as he used himself to insist on,    saying that ""there must be a systole and diastole in all inquiry,""    and that ""a man's mind must be continually expanding and shrinking    between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object-glass.""    That evening he seemed to be talking widely for the sake of resisting    any personal bearing; and before long they went into the drawing room,    where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond to give them music, sank back    in his chair in silence, but with a strange light in his eyes.     ""He may have been taking an opiate,"" was a thought that crossed    Mr. Farebrother's mind--""tic-douloureux perhaps--or medical worries.""        It did not occur to him that Lydgate's marriage was not delightful:     he believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable,    docile creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting--    a little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school;    and his mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed    to see that Henrietta Noble was in the room.  ""However, Lydgate    fell in love with her,"" said the Vicar to himself, ""and she must    be to his taste.""        Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having    very little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care    about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish,    he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank,    as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs.     And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller's, the Vicar    learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an    opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted    to open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.        The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy's, where, on New Year's Day,    there was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited,    on the plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first    new year of his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar.     And this party was thoroughly friendly:  all the ladies of the    Farebrother family were present; the Vincy children all dined    at the table, and Fred had persuaded his mother that if she did    not invite Mary Garth, the Farebrothers would regard it as a slight    to themselves, Mary being their particular friend.  Mary came, and Fred    was in high spirits, though his enjoyment was of a checkered kind--    triumph that his mother should see Mary's importance with the chief    personages in the party being much streaked with jealousy when    Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.  Fred used to be much more easy    about his own accomplishments in the days when he had not begun    to dread being ""bowled out by Farebrother,"" and this terror was    still before him.  Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest matronly bloom,    looked at Mary's little figure, rough wavy hair, and visage quite    without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying unsuccessfully    to fancy herself caring about Mary's appearance in wedding clothes,    or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would ""feature"" the Garths.     However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was particularly bright;    being glad, for Fred's sake, that his friends were getting    kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should    see how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be judges.        Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy    spoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly    graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar    had not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total    absence of that interest in her husband's presence which a loving    wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him.     When Lydgate was taking part in the conversation, she never looked    towards him any more than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled    to look another way:  and when, after being called out for an hour    or two, he re-entered the room, she seemed unconscious of the fact,    which eighteen months before would have had the effect of a numeral    before ciphers.  In reality, however, she was intensely aware    of Lydgate's voice and movements; and her pretty good-tempered air    of unconsciousness was a studied negation by which she satisfied    her inward opposition to him without compromise of propriety.     When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate had been    called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond    happened to be near her, said--""You have to give up a great deal    of your husband's society, Mrs. Lydgate.""        ""Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous:  especially when he    is so devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,"" said Rosamond,    who was standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct    little speech.        ""It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company,""    said Mrs. Vincy, who was seated at the old lady's side.     ""I am sure I thought so when Rosamond was ill, and I was staying    with her.  You know, Mrs. Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house.     I am of a cheerful disposition myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes    something to be going on.  That is what Rosamond has been used to.     Very different from a husband out at odd hours, and never knowing    when he will come home, and of a close, proud disposition,    _I_ think""--indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her tone slightly with    this parenthesis.  ""But Rosamond always had an angel of a temper;    her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was never    the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as good,    and with a complexion beyond anything.  But my children are all    good-tempered, thank God.""        This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw    back her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls,    aged from seven to eleven.  But in that smiling glance she was    obliged to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into    a corner to make her tell them stories.  Mary was just finishing    the delicious tale of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart,    because Letty was never tired of communicating it to her ignorant    elders from a favorite red volume.  Louisa, Mrs. Vincy's darling,    now ran to her with wide-eyed serious excitement, crying, ""Oh mamma,    mamma, the little man stamped so hard on the floor he couldn't    get his leg out again!""        ""Bless you, my cherub!"" said mamma; ""you shall tell me all about it    to-morrow. Go and listen!"" and then, as her eyes followed Louisa    back towards the attractive corner, she thought that if Fred wished    her to invite Mary again she would make no objection, the children    being so pleased with her.        But presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr. Farebrother    came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her on his lap;    whereupon the girls all insisted that he must hear Rumpelstiltskin,    and Mary must tell it over again.  He insisted too, and Mary,    without fuss, began again in her neat fashion, with precisely    the same words as before.  Fred, who had also seated himself near,    would have felt unmixed triumph in Mary's effectiveness if    Mr. Farebrother had not been looking at her with evident admiration,    while he dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please    the children.        ""You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,""    said Fred at the end.        ""Yes, I shall.  Tell about him now,"" said Louisa.        ""Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out.  Ask Mr. Farebrother.""        ""Yes,"" added Mary; ""ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants    whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom,    and he thought they didn't mind because he couldn't hear them cry,    or see them use their pocket-handkerchiefs.""        ""Please,"" said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar.        ""No, no, I am a grave old parson.  If I try to draw a story out    of my bag a sermon comes instead.  Shall I preach you a sermon?""    said he, putting on his short-sighted glasses, and pursing up    his lips.        ""Yes,"" said Louisa, falteringly.        ""Let me see, then.  Against cakes:  how cakes are bad things,    especially if they are sweet and have plums in them.""        Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the    Vicar's knee to go to Fred.        ""Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year's Day,""    said Mr. Farebrother, rising and walking--away.  He had discovered    of late that Fred had become jealous of him, and also that he    himself was not losing his preference for Mary above all other women.        ""A delightful young person is Miss Garth,"" said Mrs. Farebrother,    who had been watching her son's movements.        ""Yes,"" said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned    to her expectantly.  ""It is a pity she is not better-looking.""        ""I cannot say that,"" said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively.  ""I like    her countenance.  We must not always ask for beauty, when a good    God has seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it.     I put good manners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct    herself in any station.""        The old lady was a little sharp in her tone, having a prospective    reference to Mary's becoming her daughter-in-law; for there was this    inconvenience in Mary's position with regard to Fred, that it was    not suitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick    Parsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth.        New visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music    and games, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room    on the other side of the hall.  Mr. Farebrother played a rubber    to satisfy his mother, who regarded her occasional whist as a    protest against scandal and novelty of opinion, in which light    even a revoke had its dignity.  But at the end he got Mr. Chichely    to take his place, and left the room.  As he crossed the hall,    Lydgate had just come in and was taking off his great-coat.        ""You are the man I was going to look for,"" said the Vicar;    and instead of entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall    and stood against the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make    a glowing bank.  ""You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,""    he went on, smiling at Lydgate, ""now I don't play for money.     I owe that to you, Mrs. Casaubon says.""        ""How?"" said Lydgate, coldly.        ""Ah, you didn't mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.     You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have    done him a good turn.  I don't enter into some people's dislike    of being under an obligation:  upon my word, I prefer being under    an obligation to everybody for behaving well to me.""        ""I can't tell what you mean,"" said Lydgate, ""unless it is that I once    spoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon.  But I did not think that she would    break her promise not to mention that I had done so,"" said Lydgate,    leaning his back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing    no radiance in his face.        ""It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day.  He paid me    the compliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living    though you had come across his tactics, and had praised me up as a    lien and a Tillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Casaubon    would hear of no one else.""        ""Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool,"" said Lydgate, contemptuously.        ""Well, I was glad of the leakiness then.  I don't see why you    shouldn't like me to know that you wished to do me a service,    my dear fellow.  And you certainly have done me one.  It's rather    a strong check to one's self-complacency to find how much of one's    right doing depends on not being in want of money.  A man will not    be tempted to say the Lord's Prayer backward to please the devil,    if he doesn't want the devil's services.  I have no need to hang    on the smiles of chance now.""        ""I don't see that there's any money-getting without chance,""    said Lydgate; ""if a man gets it in a profession, it's pretty sure    to come by chance.""        Mr. Farebrother thought he could account for this speech, in striking    contrast with Lydgate's former way of talking, as the perversity    which will often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease    in his affairs.  He answered in a tone of good-humored admission--        ""Ah, there's enormous patience wanted with the way of the world.     But it is the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends    who love him, and ask for nothing better than to help him through,    so far as it lies in their power.""        ""Oh yes,"" said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his attitude    and looking at his watch.  ""People make much more of their    difficulties than they need to do.""        He knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help    to himself from Mr. Farebrother, and he could not bear it.     So strangely determined are we mortals, that, after having been    long gratified with the sense that he had privately done the Vicar    a service, the suggestion that the Vicar discerned his need of a    service in return made him shrink into unconquerable reticence.     Besides, behind all making of such offers what else must come?--that he    should ""mention his case,"" imply that he wanted specific things.     At that moment, suicide seemed easier.        Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that reply,    and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate's manner and tone,    corresponding with his physique, which if he repelled your advances    in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of question.        ""What time are you?"" said the Vicar, devouring his wounded feeling.        ""After eleven,"" said Lydgate.  And they went into the drawing-room.      "
88,Ann Veronica,110,H. G. Wells  ,Chapter06,"chapter02           CHAPTER II   ROSES AND THORNS        'By the soft green light in the  woody glade,      On the banks of moss where thy childhood  played;      By the household tree, thro' which  thine eye      First looked in love to the summer  sky.'   MRS. HEMANS.      Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly home with  her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding. Her mother had been  detained at home by a multitude of half-reasons, none of which anybody  fully understood, except Mr. Hale, who was perfectly aware that all his  arguments in favour of a grey satin gown, which was midway between oldness  and newness, had proved unavailing; and that, as he had not the money to  equip his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not show herself at her  only sister's only child's wedding. If Mrs. Shaw had guessed at the real  reason why Mrs. Hale did not accompany her husband, she would have showered  down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty years since Mrs. Shaw had  been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she had really forgotten all  grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age  in married life, on which she could descant by the half-hour. Dearest Maria  had married the man of her heart, only eight years older than herself,  with the sweetest temper, and that blue-black hair one so seldom sees.  Mr. Hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard, and  a perfect model of a parish priest. Perhaps it was not quite a logical  deduction from all these premises, but it was still Mrs. Shaw's characteristic  conclusion, as she thought over her sister's lot: 'Married for love, what  can dearest Maria have to wish for in this world?' Mrs. Hale, if she spoke  truth, might have answered with a ready-made list, 'a silver-grey glace  silk, a white chip bonnet, oh! dozens of things for the wedding, and hundreds  of things for the house.'   Margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come,  and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting would take  place at Helstone parsonage, rather than, during the confusion of the last  two or three days, in the house in Harley Street, where she herself had  had to play the part of Figaro, and was wanted everywhere at one and the  same time. Her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she  had done and said within the last forty-eight hours. The farewells so hurriedly  taken, amongst all the other good-byes, of those she had lived with so  long, oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more;  it did not signify what those times had been, they were gone never to return.  Margaret's heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it possible  in going to her own dear home, the place and the life she had longed for  for years--at that time of all times for yearning and longing, just before  the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep. She took her mind away with  a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation  of the hopeful future. Her eyes began to see, not visions of what had been,  but the sight actually before her; her dear father leaning back asleep  in the railway carriage. His blue-black hair was grey now, and lay thinly  over his brows. The bones of his face were plainly to be seen--too plainly  for beauty, if his features had been less finely cut; as it was, they had  a grace if not a comeliness of their own. The face was in repose; but it  was rather rest after weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance  of one who led a placid, contented life. Margaret was painfully struck  by the worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed  circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that  spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.   'Poor Frederick!' thought she, sighing. 'Oh! if Frederick had but been  a clergyman, instead of going into the navy, and being lost to us all!  I wish I knew all about it. I never understood it from Aunt Shaw; I only  knew he could not come back to England because of that terrible affair.  Poor dear papa! how sad he looks! I am so glad I am going home, to be at  hand to comfort him and mamma.   She was ready with a bright smile, in which there was not a trace of fatigue,  to greet her father when he awakened. He smiled back again, but faintly,  as if it were an unusual exertion. His face returned into its lines of  habitual anxiety. He had a trick of half-opening his mouth as if to speak,  which constantly unsettled the form of the lips, and gave the face an undecided  expression. But he had the same large, soft eyes as his daughter,--eyes  which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits, and were well  veiled by their transparent white eyelids. Margaret was more like him than  like her mother. Sometimes people wondered that parents so handsome should  have a daughter who was so far from regularly beautiful; not beautiful  at all, was occasionally said. Her mouth was wide; no rosebud that could  only open just' enough to let out a 'yes' and 'no,' and 'an't please you,  sir.' But the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips; and the skin,  if not white and fair, was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy. If the  look on her face was, in general, too dignified and reserved for one so  young, now, talking to her father, it was bright as the morning,--full  of dimples, and glances that spoke of childish gladness, and boundless  hope in the future.   It was the latter part of July when Margaret returned home. The forest  trees were all one dark, full, dusky green; the fern below them caught  all the slanting sunbeams; the weather was sultry and broodingly still.  Margaret used to tramp along by her father's side, crushing down the fern  with a cruel glee, as she felt it yield under her light foot, and send  up the fragrance peculiar to it,--out on the broad commons into the warm  scented light, seeing multitudes of wild, free, living creatures, revelling  in the sunshine, and the herbs and flowers it called forth. This life--at  least these walks--realised all Margaret's anticipations. She took a pride  in her forest. Its people were her people. She made hearty friends with  them; learned and delighted in using their peculiar words; took up her  freedom amongst them; nursed their babies; talked or read with slow distinctness  to their old people; carried dainty messes to their sick; resolved before  long to teach at the school, where her father went every day as to an appointed  task, but she was continually tempted off to go and see some individual  friend--man, woman, or child--in some cottage in the green shade of the  forest. Her out-of-doors life was perfect. Her in-doors life had its drawbacks.  With the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness  of sight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there. Her mother--her  mother always so kind and tender towards her--seemed now and then so much  discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop strangely neglected  his episcopal duties, in not giving Mr. Hale a better living; and almost  reproached her husband because he could not bring himself to say that he  wished to leave the parish, and undertake the charge of a larger. He would  sigh aloud as he answered, that if he could do what he ought in little  Helstone, he should be thankful; but every day he was more overpowered;  the world became more bewildering. At each repeated urgency of his wife,  that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment, Margaret  saw that her father shrank more and more; and she strove at such times  to reconcile her mother to Helstone. Mrs. Hale said that the near neighbourhood  of so many trees affected her health; and Margaret would try to tempt her  forth on to the beautiful) broad, upland, sun-streaked, cloud-shadowed  common; for she was sure that her mother had accustomed herself too much  to an in-doors life, seldom extending her walks beyond the church, the  school, and the neighbouring cottages. This did good for a time; but when  the autumn drew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's  idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even  more frequently that her husband, who was more learned than Mr. Hume, a  better parish priest than Mr. Houldsworth, should not have met with the  preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done.   This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what  Margaret was unprepared for. She knew, and had rather revelled in the idea,  that she should have to give up many luxuries, which had only been troubles  and trammels to her freedom in Harley Street. Her keen enjoyment of every  sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her conscious  pride in being able to do without them all, if need were. But the cloud  never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it.  There had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mother's part,  over some trifle connected with Helstone, and her father's position there,  when Margaret had been spending her holidays at home before; but in the  general happiness of the recollection of those times, she had forgotten  the small details which were not so pleasant.   In the latter half of September, the autumnal rains and storms came on,  and Margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto  done. Helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard  of cultivation.   'It is undoubtedly one of the most out-of-the-way places in England,' said  Mrs. Hale, in one of her plaintive moods. 'I can't help regretting constantly  that papa has really no one to associate with here; he is so thrown away;  seeing no one but farmers and labourers from week's end to week's end.  If we only lived at the other side of the parish, it would be something;  there we should be almost within walking distance of the Stansfields; certainly  the Gormans would be within a walk.'   'Gormans,' said Margaret. 'Are those the Gormans who made their fortunes  in trade at Southampton? Oh! I'm glad we don't visit them. I don't like  shoppy people. I think we are far better off, knowing only cottagers and  labourers, and people without pretence.'   'You must not be so fastidious, Margaret, dear!' said her mother, secretly  thinking of a young and handsome Mr. Gorman whom she had once met at Mr.  Hume's.   'No! I call mine a very comprehensive taste; I like all people whose occupations  have to do with land; I like soldiers and sailors, and the three learned  professions, as they call them. I'm sure you don't want me to admire butchers  and bakers, and candlestick-makers, do you, mamma?'   'But the Gormans were neither butchers nor bakers, but very respectable  coach-builders.'   'Very well. Coach-building is a trade all the same, and I think a much  more useless one than that of butchers or bakers. Oh! how tired I used  to be of the drives every day in Aunt Shaw's carriage, and how I longed  to walk!'   And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather. She was so happy out of  doors, at her father's side, that she almost danced; and with the soft  violence of the west wind behind her, as she crossed some heath, she seemed  to be borne onwards, as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was  wafted along by the autumnal breeze. But the evenings were rather difficult  to fill up agreeably. Immediately after tea her father withdrew into his  small library, and she and her mother were left alone. Mrs. Hale had never  cared much for books, and had discouraged her husband, very early in their  married life, in his desire of reading aloud to her, while she worked.  At one time they had tried backgammon as a resource; but as Mr. Hale grew  to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners, he found  that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as  hardships by his wife, not to be accepted as the natural conditions of  his profession, but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they  severally arose. So he withdrew, while the children were yet young, into  his library, to spend his evenings (if he were at home), in reading the  speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight.   When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her a great  box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and had found the summer's  day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return  to town. Now there were only the well-bound little-read English Classics,  which were weeded out of her father's library to fill up the small book-shelves  in the drawing-room. Thomson's Seasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero,  were by far the lightest, newest, and most amusing. The book-shelves did  not afford much resource. Margaret told her mother every particular of  her London life, to all of which Mrs. Hale listened with interest, sometimes  amused and questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's  circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone vicarage.  On such evenings Margaret was apt to stop talking rather abruptly, and  listen to the drip-drip of the rain upon the leads of the little bow-window.  Once or twice Margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition  of the monotonous sound, while she wondered if she might venture to put  a question on a subject very near to her heart, and ask where Frederick  was now; what he was doing; how long it was since they had heard from him.  But a consciousness that her mother's delicate health, and positive dislike  to Helstone, all dated from the time of the mutiny in which Frederick had  been engaged,--the full account of which Margaret had never heard, and  which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion,--made her pause and  turn away from the subject each time she approached it. When she was with  her mother, her father seemed the best person to apply to for information;  and when with him, she thought that she could speak more easily to her  mother. Probably there was nothing much to be heard that was new. In one  of the letters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father  had told her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and  very well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones,  but not the living intelligence she longed for. Frederick was always spoken  of, in the rare times when his name was mentioned, as 'Poor Frederick.'  His room was kept exactly as he had left it; and was regularly dusted,  and put into order by Dixon, Mrs. Hale's maid, who touched no other part  of the household work, but always remembered the day when she had been  engaged by Lady Beresford as ladies' maid to Sir John's wards, the pretty  Miss Beresfords, the belles of Rutlandshire. Dixon had always considered  Mr. Hale as the blight which had fallen upon her young lady's prospects  in life. If Miss Beresford had not been in such a hurry to marry a poor  country clergyman, there was no knowing what she might not have become.  But Dixon was too loyal to desert her in her affliction and downfall (alias  her married life). She remained with her, and was devoted to her interests;  always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy, whose duty  it was to baffle the malignant giant, Mr. Hale. Master Frederick had been  her favorite and pride; and it was with a little softening of her dignified  look and manner, that she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully  as if he might be coming home that very evening.   Margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence  of Frederick, unknown to her mother, which was making her father anxious  and uneasy. Mrs. Hale did not seem to perceive any alteration in her husband's  looks or ways. His spirits were always tender and gentle, readily affected  by any small piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others. He  would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death-bed, or hearing  of any crime. But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts  were pre-occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be  relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or teaching  at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come.  Mr. Hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as usual; he was  more shut up in his study; was anxious for the village postman, whose summons  to the house-hold was a rap on the back-kitchen window-shutter--a signal  which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was sufficiently  alive to the hour of the day to understand what it was, and attend to him.  Now Mr. Hale loitered about the garden if the morning was fine, and if  not, stood dreamily by the study window until the postman had called, or  gone down the lane, giving a half-respectful, half-confidential shake of  the head to the parson, who watched him away beyond the sweet-briar hedge,  and past the great arbutus, before he turned into the room to begin his  day's work, with all the signs of a heavy heart and an occupied mind.   But Margaret was at an age when any apprehension, not absolutely based  on a knowledge of facts, is easily banished for a time by a bright sunny  day, or some happy outward circumstance. And when the brilliant fourteen  fine days of October came on, her cares were all blown away as lightly  as thistledown, and she thought of nothing but the glories of the forest.  The fern-harvest was over, and now that the rain was gone, many a deep  glade was accessible, into which Margaret had only peeped in July and August  weather. She had learnt drawing with Edith; and she had sufficiently regretted,  during the gloom of the bad weather, her idle revelling in the beauty of  the woodlands while it had yet been fine, to make her determined to sketch  what she could before winter fairly set in. Accordingly, she was busy preparing  her board one morning, when Sarah, the housemaid, threw wide open the drawing-room  door and announced, 'Mr. Henry Lennox.'       "
106,Autobiography Of Andrrew Dickson White,15,Andrew Dickson White,Volumetwo-part08,"Book Sixth          I            It was quite by half-past five--after the two men had been together    in Madame de Vionnet's drawing-room not more than a dozen minutes--    that Chad, with a look at his watch and then another at their    hostess, said genially, gaily:  ""I've an engagement, and I know you    won't complain if I leave him with you.  He'll interest you    immensely; and as for her,"" he declared to Strether, ""I assure you,    if you're at all nervous, she's perfectly safe.""        He had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee, as    they could best manage, and embarrassment was a thing that Strether    wasn't at first sure Madame de Vionnet escaped.  He escaped it    himself, to his surprise; but he had grown used by this time to    thinking of himself as brazen.  She occupied, his hostess, in the    Rue de Bellechasse, the first floor of an old house to which our    visitors had had access from an old clean court.  The court was    large and open, full of revelations, for our friend, of the habit    of privacy, the peace of intervals, the dignity of distances and    approaches; the house, to his restless sense, was in the high    homely style of an elder day, and the ancient Paris that he was    always looking for--sometimes intensely felt, sometimes more    acutely missed--was in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed    staircase and in the fine boiseries, the medallions, mouldings,    mirrors, great clear spaces, of the greyish-white salon into which    he had been shown.  He seemed at the very outset to see her in the    midst of possessions not vulgarly numerous, but hereditary    cherished charming.  While his eyes turned after a little from those    of his hostess and Chad freely talked--not in the least about HIM,    but about other people, people he didn't know, and quite as if he    did know them--he found himself making out, as a background of the    occupant, some glory, some prosperity of the First Empire, some    Napoleonic glamour, some dim lustre of the great legend; elements    clinging still to all the consular chairs and mythological brasses    and sphinxes' heads and faded surfaces of satin striped with    alternate silk.        The place itself went further back--that he guessed, and how old    Paris continued in a manner to echo there; but the post-revolutionary    period, the world he vaguely thought of as the world of Chateaubriand,    of Madame de Stael, even of the young Lamartine, had left its stamp of    harps and urns and torches, a stamp impressed on sundry small objects,    ornaments and relics.  He had never before, to his knowledge, had    present to him relics, of any special dignity, of a private order--    little old miniatures, medallions, pictures, books; books in leather    bindings, pinkish and greenish, with gilt garlands on the back, ranged,    together with other promiscuous properties, under the glass of    brass-mounted cabinets.  His attention took them all tenderly into account.    They were among the matters that marked Madame de Vionnet's    apartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey's little museum    of bargains and from Chad's lovely home; he recognised it as founded    much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to time    shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of    curiosity.  Chad and Miss Gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked    up and exchanged, sifting, selecting, comparing; whereas the mistress of    the scene before him, beautifully passive under the spell of    transmission--transmission from her father's line, he quite made up    his mind--had only received, accepted and been quiet.  When she    hadn't been quiet she had been moved at the most to some occult    charity for some fallen fortune.  There had been objects she or her    predecessors might even conceivably have parted with under need,    but Strether couldn't suspect them of having sold old pieces to get    ""better"" ones.  They would have felt no difference as to better or    worse.  He could but imagine their having felt--perhaps in    emigration, in proscription, for his sketch was slight and    confused--the pressure of want or the obligation of sacrifice.        The pressure of want--whatever might be the case with the other    force--was, however, presumably not active now, for the tokens of a    chastened ease still abounded after all, many marks of a taste    whose discriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric.  He    guessed at intense little preferences and sharp little exclusions,    a deep suspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right.    The general result of this was something for which he had no name    on the spot quite ready, but something he would have come nearest    to naming in speaking of it as the air of supreme respectability,    the consciousness, small, still, reserved, but none the less    distinct and diffused, of private honour.  The air of supreme    respectability--that was a strange blank wall for his adventure to    have brought him to break his nose against.  It had in fact, as he    was now aware, filled all the approaches, hovered in the court as    he passed, hung on the staircase as he mounted, sounded in the    grave rumble of the old bell, as little electric as possible, of    which Chad, at the door, had pulled the ancient but neatly-kept    tassel; it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular    kind that he had ever breathed.  He would have answered for it at    the end of a quarter of an hour that some of the glass cases    contained swords and epaulettes of ancient colonels and generals;    medals and orders once pinned over hearts that had long since    ceased to beat; snuff-boxes bestowed on ministers and envoys;    copies of works presented, with inscriptions, by authors now    classic.  At bottom of it all for him was the sense of her rare    unlikeness to the women he had known.  This sense had grown, since    the day before, the more he recalled her, and had been above all    singularly fed by his talk with Chad in the morning.  Everything in    fine made her immeasurably new, and nothing so new as the old house    and the old objects.  There were books, two or three, on a small    table near his chair, but they hadn't the lemon-coloured covers    with which his eye had begun to dally from the hour of his arrival    and to the opportunity of a further acquaintance with which he had    for a fortnight now altogether succumbed.  On another table, across    the room, he made out the great _Revue_; but even that familiar face,    conspicuous in Mrs. Newsome's parlours, scarce counted here as a    modern note.  He was sure on the spot--and he afterwards knew he was    right--that this was a touch of Chad's own hand.  What would Mrs.    Newsome say to the circumstance that Chad's interested ""influence""    kept her paper-knife in the _Revue_?  The interested influence at any    rate had, as we say, gone straight to the point--had in fact soon    left it quite behind.        She was seated, near the fire, on a small stuffed and fringed chair    one of the few modern articles in the room, and she leaned back in    it with her hands clasped in her lap and no movement, in all her    person, but the fine prompt play of her deep young face.  The fire,    under the low white marble, undraped and academic, had burnt down    to the silver ashes of light wood, one of the windows, at a    distance, stood open to the mildness and stillness, out of which,    in the short pauses, came the faint sound, pleasant and homely,    almost rustic, of a plash and a clatter of sabots from some    coach-house on the other side of the court.  Madame de Vionnet,    while Strether sat there, wasn't to shift her posture by an inch.    ""I don't think you seriously believe in what you're doing,"" she    said; ""but all the same, you know, I'm going to treat you quite as    if I did.""        ""By which you mean,"" Strether directly replied, ""quite as if you    didn't!  I assure you it won't make the least difference with me how    you treat me.""        ""Well,"" she said, taking that menace bravely and    philosophically enough, ""the only thing that really matters is that    you shall get on with me.""        ""Ah but I don't!"" he immediately returned.        It gave her another pause; which, however, she happily enough shook    off.  ""Will you consent to go on with me a little--provisionally--    as if you did?""        Then it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way; and    there accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from    somewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes.  He might have    been perched at his door-step or at his window and she standing in    the road.  For a moment he let her stand and couldn't moreover have    spoken.  It had been sad, of a sudden, with a sadness that was like    a cold breath in his face.  ""What can I do,"" he finally asked, ""but    listen to you as I promised Chadwick?""        ""Ah but what I'm asking you,"" she quickly said, ""isn't what Mr.    Newsome had in mind."" She spoke at present, he saw, as if to take    courageously ALL her risk.  ""This is my own idea and a different    thing.""        It gave poor Strether in truth--uneasy as it made him too--    something of the thrill of a bold perception justified.  ""Well,"" he    answered kindly enough, ""I was sure a moment since that some idea    of your own had come to you.""        She seemed still to look up at him, but now more serenely.  ""I made    out you were sure--and that helped it to come.  So you see,"" she    continued, ""we do get on.""        ""Oh but it appears to me I don't at all meet your request.  How can    I when I don't understand it?""        ""It isn't at all necessary you should understand; it will do quite    well enough if you simply remember it.  Only feel I trust you--and    for nothing so tremendous after all.  Just,"" she said with a    wonderful smile, ""for common civility.""        Strether had a long pause while they sat again face to face, as    they had sat, scarce less conscious, before the poor lady had    crossed the stream.  She was the poor lady for Strether now because    clearly she had some trouble, and her appeal to him could only mean    that her trouble was deep.  He couldn't help it; it wasn't his    fault; he had done nothing; but by a turn of the hand she had    somehow made their encounter a relation.  And the relation profited    by a mass of things that were not strictly in it or of it; by the    very air in which they sat, by the high cold delicate room, by the    world outside and the little plash in the court, by the First    Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets, by matters as far off    as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp of her hands    in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural    when her eyes were most fixed.  ""You count upon me of course for    something really much greater than it sounds.""        ""Oh it sounds great enough too!"" she laughed at this.        He found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was,    as Miss Barrace called it, wonderful; but, catching himself up, he    said something else instead.  ""What was it Chad's idea then that you    should say to me?""        ""Ah his idea was simply what a man's idea always is--to put every    effort off on the woman.""        ""The 'woman'--?"" Strether slowly echoed.        ""The woman he likes--and just in proportion as he likes her.  In    proportion too--for shifting the trouble--as she likes HIM.""        Strether followed it; then with an abruptness of his own:    ""How much do you like Chad?""        ""Just as much as THAT--to take all, with you, on myself."" But she    got at once again away from this.  ""I've been trembling as if we    were to stand or fall by what you may think of me; and I'm even    now,"" she went on wonderfully, ""drawing a long breath--and, yes,    truly taking a great courage--from the hope that I don't in fact    strike you as impossible.""        ""That's at all events, clearly,"" he observed after an instant, ""the    way I don't strike YOU.""        ""Well,"" she so far assented, ""as you haven't yet said you WON'T    have the little patience with me I ask for--""        ""You draw splendid conclusions?  Perfectly.  But I don't understand    them,"" Strether pursued.  ""You seem to me to ask for much more than      you need.  What, at the worst for you, what at the best for myself,    can I after all do?  I can use no pressure that I haven't used.  You    come really late with your request.  I've already done all that for    myself the case admits of.  I've said my say, and here I am.""        ""Yes, here you are, fortunately!"" Madame de Vionnet laughed.  ""Mrs.    Newsome,"" she added in another tone, ""didn't think you can do so    little.""        He had an hesitation, but he brought the words out.  ""Well, she    thinks so now.""        ""Do you mean by that--?"" But she also hung fire.        ""Do I mean what?""        She still rather faltered.  ""Pardon me if I touch on it, but if I'm    saying extraordinary things, why, perhaps, mayn't I?  Besides,    doesn't it properly concern us to know?""        ""To know what?"" he insisted as after thus beating about the bush    she had again dropped.        She made the effort.  ""Has she given you up?""        He was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met    it.  ""Not yet."" It was almost as if he were a trifle disappointed--    had expected still more of her freedom.  But he went straight on.    ""Is that what Chad has told you will happen to me?""        She was evidently charmed with the way he took it.  ""If you mean if    we've talked of it--most certainly.  And the question's not what has    had least to do with my wishing to see you.""        ""To judge if I'm the sort of man a woman CAN--?""        ""Precisely,"" she exclaimed--""you wonderful gentleman! I do judge--I    HAVE judged.  A woman can't.  You're safe--with every right to be.    You'd be much happier if you'd only believe it.""        Strether was silent a little; then he found himself speaking with a    cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were    strange to him.  ""I try to believe it.  But it's a marvel,"" he    exclaimed, ""how YOU already get at it!""        Oh she was able to say.  ""Remember how much I was on the way to it    through Mr. Newsome--before I saw you.  He thinks everything of your    strength.""        ""Well, I can bear almost anything!"" our friend briskly interrupted.    Deep and beautiful on this her smile came back, and with the effect    of making him hear what he had said just as she had heard it.  He    easily enough felt that it gave him away, but what in truth had    everything done but that?  It had been all very well to think at    moments that he was holding her nose down and that he had coerced    her:  what had he by this time done but let her practically see that    he accepted their relation?  What was their relation moreover--    though light and brief enough in form as yet--but whatever she    might choose to make it?  Nothing could prevent her--certainly he    couldn't--from making it pleasant.  At the back of his head, behind    everything, was the sense that she was--there, before him, close to    him, in vivid imperative form--one of the rare women he had so    often heard of, read of, thought of, but never met, whose very    presence, look, voice, the mere contemporaneous FACT of whom, from    the moment it was at all presented, made a relation of mere    recognition.  That was not the kind of woman he had ever found Mrs.    Newsome, a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to    establish herself; and at present, confronted with Madame de    Vionnet, he felt the simplicity of his original impression of Miss    Gostrey.  She certainly had been a fact of rapid growth; but the    world was wide, each day was more and more a new lesson.  There were    at any rate even among the stranger ones relations and relations.    ""Of course I suit Chad's grand way,"" he quickly added.  ""He hasn't    had much difficulty in working me in.""        She seemed to deny a little, on the young man's behalf, by the rise    of her eyebrows, an intention of any process at all inconsiderate.    ""You must know how grieved he'd be if you were to lose anything.  He    believes you can keep his mother patient.""        Strether wondered with his eyes on her.  ""I see.  THAT'S then what    you really want of me.  And how am I to do it?  Perhaps you'll tell    me that.""        ""Simply tell her the truth.""        ""And what do you call the truth?""        ""Well, any truth--about us all--that you see yourself.  I leave it    to you.""        ""Thank you very much.  I like,"" Strether laughed with a slight    harshness, ""the way you leave things!""        But she insisted kindly, gently, as if it wasn't so bad.  ""Be    perfectly honest.  Tell her all.""        ""All?"" he oddly echoed.        ""Tell her the simple truth,"" Madame de Vionnet again pleaded.        ""But what is the simple truth?  The simple truth is exactly what I'm    trying to discover.""        She looked about a while, but presently she came back to him.  ""Tell    her, fully and clearly, about US.""        Strether meanwhile had been staring.  ""You and your daughter?""        ""Yes--little Jeanne and me.  Tell her,"" she just slightly quavered,    ""you like us.""        ""And what good will that do me?  Or rather""--he caught himself up--    ""what good will it do YOU?""        She looked graver.  ""None, you believe, really?""        Strether debated.  ""She didn't send me out to 'like' you.""        ""Oh,"" she charmingly contended, ""she sent you out to face the    facts.""        He admitted after an instant that there was something in that.  ""But    how can I face them till I know what they are?  Do you want him,"" he    then braced himself to ask, ""to marry your daughter?""        She gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt.  ""No--not that.""        ""And he really doesn't want to himself?""        She repeated the movement, but now with a strange light in her    face.  ""He likes her too much.""        Strether wondered.  ""To be willing to consider, you mean, the    question of taking her to America?""        ""To be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and    nice--really tender of her.  We watch over her, and you must help    us.  You must see her again.""        Strether felt awkward.  ""Ah with pleasure--she's so remarkably    attractive.""        The mother's eagerness with which Madame de Vionnet jumped at this    was to come back to him later as beautiful in its grace.  ""The dear    thing DID please you?"" Then as he met it with the largest ""Oh!"" of    enthusiasm:  ""She's perfect.  She's my joy.""        ""Well, I'm sure that--if one were near her and saw more of her--    she'd be mine.""        ""Then,"" said Madame de Vionnet, ""tell Mrs. Newsome that!""        He wondered the more.  ""What good will that do you?"" As she appeared    unable at once to say, however, he brought out something else.  ""Is    your daughter in love with our friend?""        ""Ah,"" she rather startlingly answered, ""I wish you'd find out!""        He showed his surprise.  ""I?  A stranger?""        ""Oh you won't be a stranger--presently.  You shall see her quite, I    assure you, as if you weren't.""        It remained for him none the less an extraordinary notion.  ""It    seems to me surely that if her mother can't--""        ""Ah little girls and their mothers to-day!"" she rather inconsequently    broke in.  But she checked herself with something she seemed to give    out as after all more to the point.  ""Tell her I've been good for    him.  Don't you think I have?""        It had its effect on him--more than at the moment he quite measured.    Yet he was consciously enough touched.  ""Oh if it's all you--!""        ""Well, it may not be 'all,'"" she interrupted, ""but it's to a great    extent.  Really and truly,"" she added in a tone that was to take its    place with him among things remembered.        ""Then it's very wonderful.""  He smiled at her from a face that he    felt as strained, and her own face for a moment kept him so.  At    last she also got up.  ""Well, don't you think that for that--""        ""I ought to save you?""  So it was that the way to meet her--and the    way, as well, in a manner, to get off--came over him.  He heard    himself use the exorbitant word, the very sound of which helped to    determine his flight.  ""I'll save you if I can.""    "
120,Blix,89,Frank Norris,Chapter08,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer: Chapter 7        CHAPTER VII  THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas  wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed  to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.  There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The  drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul  like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine,  Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,  tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high  in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were  asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest  to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his  face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not  know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the  tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with  a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature:  for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with  a pin and made him take a new direction.     Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been,  and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in  an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends  all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of  his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew  in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each  other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's  slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.     ""Now,"" said he, ""as long as he is on your side you can stir him  up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,  you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.""     ""All right, go ahead; start him up.""     The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.  Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This  change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with  absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the  two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all  things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick  tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious  as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory  in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to  begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last  Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached  out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:     ""Tom, you let him alone.""     ""I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.""     ""No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.""     ""Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.""     ""Let him alone, I tell you.""     ""I won't!""     ""You shall -- he's on my side of the line.""     ""Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?""     ""I don't care whose tick he is -- he's on my side of the line,  and you sha'n't touch him.""     ""Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do  what I blame please with him, or die!""     A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate  on Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from  the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too  absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before  when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had  contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit  of variety to it.     When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and  whispered in her ear:     ""Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you  get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through  the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the  same way.""     So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other  with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane,  and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they  sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and  held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house.  When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was  swimming in bliss. He said:     ""Do you love rats?""     ""No! I hate them!""     ""Well, I do, too -- live ones. But I mean dead ones, to  swing round your head with a string.""     ""No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.""     ""Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.""     ""Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must  give it back to me.""     That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled  their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.     ""Was you ever at a circus?"" said Tom.     ""Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.""     ""I been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times. Church  ain't shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time.  I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.""     ""Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted  up.""     ""Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money -- most a dollar  a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?""     ""What's that?""     ""Why, engaged to be married.""     ""No.""     ""Would you like to?""     ""I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?""     ""Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you  won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss  and that's all. Anybody can do it.""     ""Kiss? What do you kiss for?""     ""Why, that, you know, is to -- well, they always do that.""     ""Everybody?""     ""Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember  what I wrote on the slate?""     ""Ye -- yes.""     ""What was it?""     ""I sha'n't tell you.""     ""Shall I tell you?""     ""Ye -- yes -- but some other time.""     ""No, now.""     ""No, not now -- to-morrow.""     ""Oh, no, now. Please, Becky -- I'll whisper it, I'll whisper  it ever so easy.""     Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his  arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth  close to her ear. And then he added:     ""Now you whisper it to me -- just the same.""     She resisted, for a while, and then said:     ""You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But  you mustn't ever tell anybody -- will you, Tom? Now you won't, will  you?""     ""No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.""     He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath  stirred his curls and whispered, ""I -- love -- you!""     Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,  with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little  white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:     ""Now, Becky, it's all done -- all over but the kiss. Don't you  be afraid of that -- it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky."" And he tugged  at her apron and the hands.     By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing  with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:     ""Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you  ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody  but me, ever never and forever. Will you?""     ""No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry  anybody but you -- and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.""     ""Certainly. Of course. That's part of it. And always coming  to school or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there  ain't anybody looking -- and you choose me and I choose you at parties,  because that's the way you do when you're engaged.""     ""It's so nice. I never heard of it before.""     ""Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence --""     The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.     ""Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!""     The child began to cry. Tom said:     ""Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.""     ""Yes, you do, Tom -- you know you do.""     Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away  and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with  soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was  up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy,  for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would  repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly  and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make  new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still  standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall.  Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly  how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:     ""Becky, I -- I don't care for anybody but you.""     No reply -- but sobs.     ""Becky"" -- pleadingly. ""Becky, won't you say something?""     More sobs.     Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an  andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:     ""Please, Becky, won't you take it?""     She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house  and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day.  Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight;  she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:     ""Tom! Come back, Tom!""     She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions  but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself;  and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide  her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long,  dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange  sorrows with.             "
146,Cranford,72,Elizabeth C. Gaskell  ,Chapter09,"chapter49         Chapter 49   We took another swim in the Sea of Galilee at twilight yesterday, and  another at sunrise this morning. We have not sailed, but three swims are  equal to a sail, are they not? There were plenty of fish visible in the  water, but we have no outside aids in this pilgrimage but ""Tent Life in  the Holy Land,"" ""The Land and the Book,"" and other literature of like description--no  fishing-tackle. There were no fish to be had in the village of Tiberias.  True, we saw two or three vagabonds mending their nets, but never trying  to catch any thing with them.    We did not go to the ancient warm baths two miles below Tiberias. I  had no desire in the world to go there. This seemed a little strange, and  prompted me to try to discover what the cause of this unreasonable indifference  was. It turned out to be simply because Pliny mentions them. I have conceived  a sort of unwarrantable unfriendliness toward Pliny and St. Paul, because  it seems as if I can never ferret out a place that I can have to myself.  It always and eternally transpires that St. Paul has been to that place,  and Pliny has ""mentioned"" it.    In the early morning we mounted and started. And then a weird apparition  marched forth at the head of the procession- a pirate, I thought, if ever  a pirate dwelt upon land. It was a tall Arab, as swarthy as an Indian;  young-say thirty years of age. On his head he had closely bound a gorgeous  yellow and red striped silk scarf, whose ends, lavishly fringed with tassels,  hung down between his shoulders and dallied with the wind. From his neck  to his knees, in ample folds, a robe swept down that was a very star-spangled  banner of curved and sinuous bars of black and white. Out of his back,  somewhere, apparently, the long stem of a chibouk projected, and reached  far above his right shoulder. Athwart his back, diagonally, and extending  high above his left shoulder, was an Arab gum of Saladin's time, that was  splendid with silver plating from stock clear up to the end of its measureless  stretch of barrel. About his waist was bound many and many a yard of elaborately  figured but sadly tarnished stuff that came from sumptuous Persia, and  among the baggy folds in front the sunbeams glinted from a formidable battery  of old brass-mounted horse-pistols and the gilded hilts of blood-thirsty  knives. There were holsters for more pistols appended to the wonderful  stack of long-haired goat-skins and Persian carpets, which the man had  been taught to regard in the light of a saddle; and down among the pendulous  rank of vast tassels that swung from that saddle, and clanging against  the iron shovel of a stirrup that propped the warrior's knees up toward  his chin, was a crooked, silver-clad scimitar of such awful dimensions  and such implacable expression that no man might hope to look upon it and  not shudder. The fringed and bedizened prince whose privilege it is to  ride the pony and lead the elephant into a country village is poor and  naked compared to this chaos of paraphernalia, and the happy vanity of  the one is the very poverty of satisfaction compared to the magestic serenity,  the overwhelming complacency of the other.    ""Who is this? What is this?"" That was the trembling inquiry all down  the line.    ""Our guard! From Galilee to the birthplace of the Savior, the country  is infested with fierce Bedouins, whose sole happiness it is, in this life,  to cut and stab and mangle and murder unoffending Christians. Allah be  with us!""    ""Then hire a regiment! Would you send us out among these desperate hordes,  with no salvation in our utmost need but this old turret?""    The dragoman laughed-not at the facetiousness of the simile, for verily,  that guide or that courier or that dragoman never yet lived upon earth  who had in him the faintest appreciation of a joke, even though that joke  were so broad and so ponderous that if it fell on him it would flatten  him out like a postage stamp-the dragoman laughed, and then, emboldened  by some thought that was in his brain, no doubt, proceeded to extremities  and winked.    In straits like these, when a man laughs, it is encouraging when he  winks, it is positively reassuring. He finally inti- mated that one guard  would be sufflcient to protect us, but that that one was an absolute necessity.  It was because of the moral weight his awful panoply would have with the  Bedouins. Then I said we didn't want any guard at all. If one fantastic  vagabond could protect eight armed Christians and a pack of Arab servants  from all harm, surely that detachment could protect themselves. He shook  his head doubtfully. Then I said, just think of how it looks-think cf now  it would read, to self-reliant Americans, that we went sneaking through  this deserted wilderness under the protection of this masquerading Arab,  who would break his neck getting out of the country if a man that was  a man ever started after him. It was a mean, low, degrading position. Why  were we ever told to bring navy revolvers with us if we had to be protected  at last by this infamous star-spangled scum of the desert? These appeals  were vain-the dragoman only smiled and shook his head.    I rode to the front and struck up an acquaintance with King Solomon-in-all-his-glory,  and got him to show me his lingering eternity of a gun. It had a rusty  dint lock; it was ringed and barred and plated with silver from end to  end, but it was as desperately out of the perpendicular as are the billiard  cues of '49 that one finds yet in service in the ancient mining camps of  California. The muzzle was eaten by the rust of centuries into a ragged  filigree-work, like the end of a burntout stove-pipe. I shut one eye and  peered within--it was flaked with iron rust like an old steamboat boiler.  I borrowed the ponderous pistols and snapped them. They were rusty in-  side, too-had not been loaded for a generation. I went back, full of encouragement,  and reported to the guide, and asked him to discharge this dismantled fortress.  It came out, then. This fellow was a retainer of the Sheik of Tiberias.  He was a source of Government revenue. He was to the Empire of Tiberias  what the customs are to America. The Sheik imposed guards upon travelers  and charged them for it. It is a lucrative source of emolument, and sometimes  brings into the national treasury as much as thirty-five or forty dollars  a year.    I knew the warrior's secret now; I knew the hollow vanity of his rusty  trumpery, and despised his asinine complacency. I told on him, and with  reckless daring the cavalcade straight ahead into the perilous solitudes  of the desert, and scorned his frantic warnings of the mutilation and death  that hovered about them on every side.    Arrived at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above the lake, (I ought  to mention that the lake lies six hundred feet below the level of the Mediterranean-no  traveler ever neglects to flourish that fragment of news in his letters,)  as bald and unthrilling a panorama as any land can afford, perhaps, was  spread out before us. Yet it was so crowded with historical interest, that  if all the pages that have been written about it were spread upon its surface,  they would flag it from horizon to horizon like a pavement. Among the localities  comprised in this view, were Mount Hermon; the hills that border Ceasurea  Philippi, Dan, the Sources of the Jordan and the Waters of Merom; Tiberias;  the Sea of Galilee; Joseph's Pit; Capernaum; Bethsaida; the supposed scenes  of the Sermon on the Mount, the feeding of the multitudes and the miraculous  draught of fishes; the declivity down which the swine ran to the sea; the  entrance and the exit of the Jordan; Safed, ""the city set upon a hill,""  one of the four holy cities of the Jews, and the place where they believe  the real Messiah will appear when he comes to redeem the world; part of  the battle-field of Hattin, where the knightly Crusaders fought their last  fight, and in a blaze of glory passed from the stage and ended their splendid  career forever; Mount Tabor, the traditional scene of the Lord's Transfiguration.  And down toward the southeast lay a landscape that suggested to my mind  a quotation (imperfectly remembered, no doubt  ""The Ephraimites not being called upon to share in the rich  spoils of the Ammonitish war, assembled a mighty host to fight against  Jeptha, Judge of Israel; who, being apprised of their approach, gathered  together the men of Israel and gave them battle and put them to flight.  To make his victory the more secure, he stationed guards at the different  fords and passages of the Jordan, with instructions to let none pass who  could not say Shibboleth. The Ephraimites, being Of a different tribe,  could not frame to pronounce the word right, but called it Sibboleth, which  proved them enemies and coet them their lives; wherefore, forty and two  thousand fell at the different fords and passages of the Jordan that day.""       We jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus  to Jerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in  the unvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fenced  round about with giant cactuses, (the sign of worthless land,) with prickly  pears upon them like hams, and came at last to the battle-field of Hattin.    It is a grand, irregular plateau, and looks as if it might have been  created for a battle-field. Here the peerless Saladin met the Christian  host some seven hundred years ago, and broke their power in Palestine for  all time to come. There had long been a truce between the opposing forces,  but according to the Guide-Book, Raynauld of Chatillon, Lord of Kerak,  broke it by plundering a Damascus caravan, and refusing to give up either  the merchants or their goods when Saladin demanded them. This conduct of  an insolent petty chieftain stung the Sultan to the quick, and he swore  that he would slaughter Raynauld with his own hand, no matter how, or when,  or where he found him. Both armies prepared for war. Under the weak King  of Jerusalem was the very flower of the Christian chivalry. He foolishly  compelled them to undergo a long, exhausting march, in the scorching sun,  and then, without water or other refreshment, ordered them to encamp in  this open plain. The splendidly mounted masses of Moslem soldiers swept  round the north end of Genessaret, burning and destroying as they came,  and pitched their camp in front of the opposing lines. At dawn the terrific  fight began. Surrounded on all sides by the Sultan's swarming battalions,  the Christian Knights fought on without a hope for their lives. They fought  with desperate valor, but to no purpose; the odds of heat and numbers,  and consuming thirst, were too great against them. Towards the middle of  the day the bravest of their band cut their way through the Moslem ranks  and gained the summit of a little hill, and there, hour after hour, they  closed around the banner of the Cross, and beat back the charging squadrons  of the enemy.    But the doom of the Christian power was sealed. Sunset found Salad in  Lord of Palestine, the Christian chivalry strewn in heaps upon the field,  and the King of Jerusalem, the Grand: faster of the Templar, and Raynauld  of Chatillon, captives in the Sultan's tent. Salad in treated two of the  prisoners with princely courtesy, and ordered refreshments to be set before  them. When the King handed an iced Sherbet to Chatillon, the Sultan said,""  It is thou that givest it to him, not I."" He remembered his oath, and slaughtered  the hapless Knight of Chatillon with his own hand.    It was hard to realize that this silent plain had once resounded with  martial music and trembled to the tramp of armed men. It was hard to people  this solitude with rushing columns of cavalry, and stir its torpid pulses  with the shouts of victors, the shrieks of the wounded, and the flash of  banner and steel above the surging billows of war. A desolation is here  that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and action.    We reached Tabor safely, and considerably in advance of that old iron-clad  swindle of a guard. We never saw a human being on the whole route, much  less lawless hordes of Bedouins. Tabor stands solitary and alone, a giant  sentinel above the Plain of Esdraelon. It rises some fourteen hundred feet  above the surrounding level, a green, wooden cone, symmetrical and full  of grace--a prominent landmark, and one that is exceedingly pleasant to  eyes surfeited with the repulsive monotony of desert Syria. We climbed  the steep path to its summit, through breezy glades of thorn and oak. The  view presented from its highest peak was almost beautiful. Below, was the  broad, level plain of Esdraelon, checkered with fields like a chess-board,  and full as smooth and level, seemingly; dotted about its borders with  white, compact villages, and faintly penciled, far and near, with the curving  lines of roads and trails. When it is robed in the fresh verdure of spring,  it must form a charming picture, even by itself. Skirting its southern  border rises ""Little Hermon,"" over whose summit a glimpse of Gilboa is  caught. Nain, famous for the raising of the widow's son, and Endor, as  famous for the performances of her witch are in view. To the eastward lies  the Valley of the Jordan and beyond it the mountains of Gilead. Westward  is Mount Carmel. Hermon in the north--the table-lands of Bashan-Safed,  the holy city, gleaming white upon a tall spur of the mountains of Lebanon--a  steel-blue corner of the Sea of Galilee--saddle-peaked Hattin, traditional  ""Mount of Beatitudes "" and mute witness brave fights of the Crusading host  for Holy Cross-- these fill up the picture.    To glance at the salient features of this landscape through the picturesque  framework of a ragged and ruined stone window--arch of the time of Christ,  thus hiding from sight all that is unattractive, is to secure to yourself  a pleasure worth climbing the mountain to enjoy. One must stand on his  head to get the best effect in a fine sunset, and set a landscape in a  bold, strong framework that is very close at hand, to bring out all its  beauty. One learns this latter truth never more to forget it, in that mimic  land of enchantment, the wonderful garden of my lord the Count Pallavicini,  near Genoa. You go wandering for hours among hills and wooded glens, artfully  contrived to leave the impression that Nature shaped them and not man;  following winding paths and coming suddenly upon leaping cascades and rustic  bridges; finding sylvan lakes where you expected them not; loitering through  battered mediæval castles in miniature that seem hoary with age and  yet were built a dozen years ago; meditating over ancient crumbling tombs,  whose marble columns were marred and broken purposely by the modern artist  that made them; stumbling unawares upon toy palaces, wrought of rare and  costly materials, and again upon a peasant's hut, whose dilapidated furniture  would never suggest that it was made so to order; sweeping round and round  in the midst of a forest on an enchanted wooden horse that is moved by  some invisible agency; traversing Roman roads and passing under majestic  triumphal arches; resting in quaint bowers where unseen spirits discharge  jets of water on you from every possible direction, and where even the  flowers you touch assail you with a shower; boating on a subterranean lake  among caverns and arches royally draped with clustering stalactites, and  passing out into open day upon another lake, which is bordered with sloping  banks of grass and gay with patrician barges that swim at anchor in the  shadow of a miniature marble temple that rises out of the clear water and  glasses its white statues, its rich capitals and fluted columns in the  tranquil depths. So, from marvel to marvel you have drifted on, thinking  all the time that the one last seen must be the chiefest. And, verily,  the chiefest wonder is reserved until the last, but you do not see it until  you step ashore, and passing through a wilderness of rare flowers, collected  from every corner of the earth, you stand at the door of one more mimic  temple. Right in this place the artist taxed his genius to the utmost,  and fairly opened the gates of fairy land. You look through an unpretending  pane of glass, stained yellow ­ the first thing you see is a mass of  quivering foliage, ten short steps before you, in the midst of which is  a ragged opening like a gateway-a thing that is common enough in nature,  and not apt to excite suspicions of a deep human design-and above the bottom  of the gateway, project, in the most careless way! a few broad tropic leaves  and brilliant flowers. All of a sudden, through this bright, bold gateway,  you catch a glimpse of the faintest, softest, richest picture that ever  graced the dream of a dying Saint, since John saw the New Jerusalem glimmering  above the clouds of Heaven. A broad sweep of sea, flecked with careening  sails; a sharp, jutting cape, and a lofty lighthouse on it; a sloping lawn  behind it; beyond, a portion of the old ""city of palaces,"" with its parks  and hills and stately mansions; beyond these, a prodigious mountain, with  its strong outlines sharply cut against ocean and sky; and over all, vagrant  shreds and flakes of cloud, floating in a sea of gold. The ocean is gold,  the city is gold, the meadow, the mountain, the sky--every thing is golden-rich,  and mellow, and dreamy as a vision of Paradise. No artist could put upon  canvas, its entrancing beauty, and yet, without the yellow glass, and the  carefully contrived accident of a framework that cast it into enchanted  distance and shut out from it all unattractive features, it was not a picture  to fall into ecstacies over. Such is life, and the trail of the serpent  is over us all.    There is nothing for it now but to come back to old Tabor, though the  subject is tiresome enough, and I can not stick to it for wandering off  to scenes that are pleasanter to remember. I think I will skip, any how.  There is nothing about Tabor (except we concede that it was the scene of  the Transfiguration,) but some gray old ruins, stacked up there in all  ages of the world from the days of stout Gideon and parties that flourished  thirty centuries ago to the fresh yesterday of Crusading times. It has  its Greek Convent, and the coffee there is good, but never a splinter of  the true cross or bone of a hallowed saint to arrest the idle thoughts  of worldlings and turn them into graver channels. Catholic church is nothing  to me that has no relics.    The plain of Esdraelon--"" the battle-field of the nations ""-- only sets  one to dreaming of Joshua, and Benhadad, and Saul, and Gideon; Tamerlane,  Tancred, Cœur de Lion, and Salad in: the warrior Kings of Persia,  Egypt's heroes, and Napoleon-- for they all fought here. If the magic of  the moonlight could summon from the graves of forgotten centuries and many  lands the countless myriads that have battled on this wide, farreaching  floor, and array them in the thousand strange Costumes of their hundred  nationalities, and send the vast host sweeping down the plain, splendid  with plumes and banners and glittering lances, I could stay here an age  to see the phantom pageant. But the magic of the moonlight is a vanity  and a fraud; and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow and  disappointment.    Down at the foot of Tabor, and just at the edge of the storied Plain  of Esdraelon, is the insignificant village of Deburieh, where Deborah,  prophetess of Israel, lived. It is just like Magdala.        "
147,Crime And Punishment,96,Fyodor Dostoevsky,Part3-chapter03,"40  A Terrible Vision        The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek    upon his hand, and looked intently at the young man for a    moment.  No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal    de Richelieu, and D'Artagnan felt this glance run through    his veins like a fever.        He however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his    hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without    too much assurance, but also without too much humility.        ""Monsieur,"" said the cardinal, ""are you a D'Artagnan from    Bearn?""        ""Yes, monseigneur,"" replied the young man.        ""There are several branches of the D'Artagnans at Tarbes and    in its environs,"" said the cardinal; ""to which do you    belong?""        ""I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under    the great King Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.""        ""That is well.  It is you who set out seven or eight months    ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital?""        ""Yes, monseigneur.""        ""You came through Meung, where something befell you.  I    don't very well know what, but still something.""        ""Monseigneur,"" said D'Artagnan, ""this was what happened to    me--""        ""Never mind, never mind!"" resumed the cardinal, with a smile    which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who    wished to relate it.  ""You were recommended to Monsieur de    Treville, were you not?""        ""Yes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at    Meung--""        ""The letter was lost,"" replied his Eminence; ""yes, I know    that.  But Monsieur de Treville is a skilled physiognomist,    who knows men at first sight; and he placed you in the    company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart, leaving    you to hope that one day or other you should enter the    Musketeers.""        ""Monseigneur is correctly informed,"" said D'Artagnan.        ""Since that time many things have happened to you.  You were    walking one day behind the Chartreux, when it would have    been better if you had been elsewhere.  Then you took with    your friends a journey to the waters of Forges; they stopped    on the road, but you continued yours.  That is all very    simple: you had business in England.""        ""Monseigneur,"" said D'Artagnan, quite confused, ""I went--""        ""Hunting at Windsor, or elsewhere--that concerns nobody.  I    know, because it is my office to know everything.  On your    return you were received by an august personage, and I    perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she    gave you.""        D'Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen's diamond, which    he wore, and quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too    late.        ""The day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,""    resumed the cardinal.  ""He went to desire you to come to the    palace.  You have not returned that visit, and you were    wrong.""        ""Monseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your    Eminence.""        ""How could that be, monsieur?  Could you incur my    displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors    with more intelligence and courage than another would have    done?  It is the people who do not obey that I punish, and    not those who, like you, obey--but too well.  As a proof,    remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to    come to me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you    that very night.""        That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme.    Bonacieux took place.  D'Artagnan trembled; and he likewise    recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman    had passed close to him, without doubt carried away by the    same power that had caused her disappearance.        ""In short,"" continued the cardinal, ""as I have heard nothing    of you for some time past, I wished to know what you were    doing.  Besides, you owe me some thanks.  You must yourself    have remarked how much you have been considered in all the    circumstances.""        D'Artagnan bowed with respect.        ""That,"" continued the cardinal, ""arose not only from a    feeling of natural equity, but likewise from a plan I have    marked out with respect to you.""        D'Artagnan became more and more astonished.        ""I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you    received my first invitation; but you did not come.    Fortunately, nothing is lost by this delay, and you are now    about to hear it.  Sit down there, before me, d'Artagnan;    you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.""  And the    cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young    man, who was so astonished at what was passing that he    awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he    obeyed.        ""You are brave, Monsieur d'Artagnan,"" continued his    Eminence;  ""you are prudent, which is still better.  I like    men of head and heart.  Don't be afraid,"" said he, smiling.    ""By men of heart I mean men of courage. But young as you    are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have powerful    enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy    you.""        ""Alas, monseigneur!"" replied the young man, ""very easily, no    doubt, for they are strong and well supported, while I am    alone.""        ""Yes, that's true; but alone as you are, you have done much    already, and will do still more, I don't doubt.  Yet you    have need, I believe, to be guided in the adventurous career    you have undertaken; for, if I mistake not, you came to    Paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune.""        ""I am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,"" said    D'Artagnan.        ""There are no extravagant but for fools, monsieur, and you    are a man of understanding.  Now, what would you say to an    ensign's commission in my Guards, and a company after the    campaign?""        ""Ah, monseigneur.""        ""You accept it, do you not?""        ""Monseigneur,"" replied D'Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.        ""How?  You refuse?"" cried the cardinal, with astonishment.        ""I am in his Majesty's Guards, monseigneur, and I have no    reason to be dissatisfied.""        ""But it appears to me that my Guards--mine--are also his    Majesty's Guards; and whoever serves in a French corps    serves the king.""        ""Monseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.""        ""You want a pretext, do you not?  I comprehend.  Well, you    have this excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the    opportunity which I offer you--so much for the world.  As    regards yourself, the need of protection; for it is fit you    should know, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I have received heavy    and serious complaints against you.  You do not consecrate    your days and nights wholly to the king's service.""        D'Artagnan colored.        ""In fact,"" said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle    of papers, ""I have here a whole pile which concerns you.  I    know you to be a man of resolution; and your services, well    directed, instead of leading you to ill, might be very    advantageous to you.  Come; reflect, and decide.""        ""Your goodness confounds me, monseigneur,"" replied    D'Artagnan, ""and I am conscious of a greatness of soul in    your Eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm; but since    Monseigneur permits me to speak freely--""        D'Artagnan paused.        ""Yes; speak.""        ""Then, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the    king's Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable    fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence; I    should, therefore, be ill received here and ill regarded    there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me.""        ""Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not    yet made you an offer equal to your value?"" asked the    cardinal, with a smile of disdain.        ""Monseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to    me;  and on the contrary, I think I have not proved myself    worthy of your goodness.  The siege of La Rochelle is about    to be resumed, monseigneur.  I shall serve under the eye of    your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to conduct    myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your    attention, then I shall at least leave behind me some    brilliant action to justify the protection with which you    honor me.  Everything is best in its time, monseigneur.    Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of giving myself;    at present I shall appear to sell myself.""        ""That is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,"" said the    cardinal, with a tone of vexation, through which, however,    might be seen a sort of esteem; ""remain free, then, and    guard your hatreds and your sympathies.""        ""Monseigneur--""        ""Well, well,"" said the cardinal, ""I don't wish you any ill;    but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to    defend and recompense our friends.  We owe nothing to our    enemies; and let me give you a piece of advice; take care of    yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, for from the moment I    withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an obolus    for your life.""        ""I will try to do so, monseigneur,"" replied the Gascon, with    a noble confidence.        ""Remember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any    mischance should happen to you,"" said Richelieu,    significantly, ""that it was I who came to seek you, and that    I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling    you.""        ""I shall entertain, whatever may happen,"" said D'Artagnan,    placing his hand upon his breast and bowing, ""an eternal    gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for    me.""        ""Well, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur    d'Artagnan; we shall see each other again after the    campaign.  I will have my eye upon you, for I shall be    there,"" replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger to a    magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, ""and on our    return, well--we will settle our account!""        ""Young man,"" said Richelieu, ""if I shall be able to say to    you at another time what I have said to you today, I promise    you to do so.""        This last expression of Richelieu's conveyed a terrible    doubt; it alarmed D'Artagnan more than a menace would have    done, for it was a warning.  The cardinal, then, was seeking    to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him.    He opened his mouth to reply, but with a haughty gesture the    cardinal dismissed him.        D'Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed    him, and he felt inclined to return.  Then the noble and    severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind; if he made the    compact with the cardinal which he required, Athos would no    more give him his hand--Athos would renounce him.        It was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the    influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds    it.        D'Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had    entered, and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his    appearance, and beginning to grow uneasy.  With a word,    D'Artagnan reassured them; and Planchet ran to inform the    other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as    his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.        Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired    eagerly the cause of the strange interview; but D'Artagnan    confined himself to telling them that M. de Richelieu had    sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with    the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.        ""And you were right,"" cried Aramis and Porthos, with one    voice.        Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing.    But when they were alone he said, ""You have done that which    you ought to have done, D'Artagnan; but perhaps you have    been wrong.""        D'Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a    secret voice of his soul, which told him that great    misfortunes awaited him.        The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for    departure.  D'Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Treville.    At that time it was believed that the separation of the    Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary, the king    holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set    out the day after.  M. de Treville contented himself with    asking D'Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but    D'Artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted.        That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards    of M. Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de    Treville who had been accustomed to associate together.    They were parting to meet again when it pleased God, and if    it pleased God.  That night, then, was somewhat riotous, as    may be imagined.  In such cases extreme preoccupation is    only to be combated by extreme carelessness.        At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends    separated; the Musketeers hastening to the hotel of M. de    Treville, the Guards to that of M. Dessessart.  Each of the    captains then led his company to the Louvre, where the king    held his review        The king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little    from his usual lofty bearing.  In fact, the evening before,    a fever had seized him in the midst of the Parliament, while    he was holding his Bed of Justice.  He had, not the less,    decided upon setting out that same evening; and in spite of    the remonstrances that had been offered to him, he persisted    in having the review, hoping by setting it at defiance to    conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him.        The review over, the Guards set forward alone on their    march, the Musketeers waiting for the king, which allowed    Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment    in the Rue aux Ours.        The procurator's wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on    his fine horse.  She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him    to part thus; she made him a sign to dismount and come to    her.  Porthos was magnificent; his spurs jingled, his    cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against his    ample limbs.  This time the clerks evinced no inclination to    laugh, such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.        The Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little    gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all    blazing new.  Nevertheless, one thing afforded him inward    consolation; it was expected by everybody that the campaign    would be a severe one.  He whispered a hope to himself that    this beloved relative might be killed in the field.        Porthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him    farewell.  M. Coquenard wished him all sorts of    prosperities.  As to Mme. Coquenard, she could not restrain    her tears; but no evil impressions were taken from her grief    as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives,    about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with    her husband.        But the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenard's chamber;    they were heartrending.        As long as the procurator's wife could follow him with her    eyes, she waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out    of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to    precipitate herself.  Porthos received all these attentions    like a man accustomed to such demonstrations, only on    turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat    gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.        On his part Aramis wrote a long letter.  To whom?  Nobody    knew.  Kitty, who was to set out that evening for Tours, was    waiting in the next chamber.        Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.        In the meantime D'Artagnan was defiling with his company.    Arriving at the Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to    look gaily at the Bastille; but as it was the Bastille alone    he looked at, he did not observe Milady, who, mounted upon a    light chestnut horse, designated him with her finger to two    ill-looking men who came close up to the ranks to take    notice of him.  To a look of interrogation which they made,    Milady replied by a sign that it was he.  Then, certain that    there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders,    she started her horse and disappeared.        The two men followed the company, and on leaving the    aubourg St. Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped,    which a servant without livery had waiting for them.    "

176,"Edison,his Life And Inventions",88,Frank L.dyer,Chapter09,"XI            ""This is the south terrace,"" Anna said.  ""Should you like to    walk down to the river?""        She seemed to listen to herself speaking from a far-off airy    height, and yet to be wholly gathered into the circle of    consciousness which drew its glowing ring about herself and    Darrow.  To the aerial listener her words sounded flat and    colourless, but to the self within the ring each one beat    with a separate heart.        It was the day after Darrow's arrival, and he had come down    early, drawn by the sweetness of the light on the lawns and    gardens below his window.  Anna had heard the echo of his    step on the stairs, his pause in the stone- flagged hall,    his voice as he asked a servant where to find her.  She was    at the end of the house, in the brown-panelled sitting-room    which she frequented at that season because it caught the    sunlight first and kept it longest.  She stood near the    window, in the pale band of brightness, arranging some    salmon-pink geraniums in a shallow porcelain bowl.  Every    sensation of touch and sight was thrice-alive in her.  The    grey- green fur of the geranium leaves caressed her fingers    and the sunlight wavering across the irregular surface of    the old parquet floor made it seem as bright and shifting as    the brown bed of a stream.        Darrow stood framed in the door-way of the farthest drawing-    room, a light-grey figure against the black and white    flagging of the hall; then he began to move toward her down    the empty pale-panelled vista, crossing one after another    the long reflections which a projecting cabinet or screen    cast here and there upon the shining floors.        As he drew nearer, his figure was suddenly displaced by that    of her husband, whom, from the same point, she had so often    seen advancing down the same perspective. Straight, spare,    erect, looking to right and left with quick precise turns of    the head, and stopping now and then to straighten a chair or    alter the position of a vase, Fraser Leath used to march    toward her through the double file of furniture like a    general reviewing a regiment drawn up for his inspection.    At a certain point, midway across the second room, he always    stopped before the mantel-piece of pinkish-yellow marble and    looked at himself in the tall garlanded glass that    surmounted it.  She could not remember that he had ever    found anything to straighten or alter in his own studied    attire, but she had never known him to omit the inspection    when he passed that particular mirror.        When it was over he continued more briskly on his way, and    the resulting expression of satisfaction was still on his    face when he entered the oak sitting-room to greet his    wife...        The spectral projection of this little daily scene hung but    for a moment before Anna, but in that moment she had time to    fling a wondering glance across the distance between her    past and present.  Then the footsteps of the present came    close, and she had to drop the geraniums to give her hand to    Darrow...        ""Yes, let us walk down to the river.""        They had neither of them, as yet, found much to say to each    other.  Darrow had arrived late on the previous afternoon,    and during the evening they had had between them Owen Leath    and their own thoughts.  Now they were alone for the first    time and the fact was enough in itself.  Yet Anna was    intensely aware that as soon as they began to talk more    intimately they would feel that they knew each other less    well.        They passed out onto the terrace and down the steps to the    gravel walk below.  The delicate frosting of dew gave the    grass a bluish shimmer, and the sunlight, sliding in emerald    streaks along the tree-boles, gathered itself into great    luminous blurs at the end of the wood-walks, and hung above    the fields a watery glory like the ring about an autumn    moon.        ""It's good to be here,"" Darrow said.        They took a turn to the left and stopped for a moment to    look back at the long pink house-front, plainer, friendlier,    less adorned than on the side toward the court.  So    prolonged yet delicate had been the friction of time upon    its bricks that certain expanses had the bloom and texture    of old red velvet, and the patches of gold lichen spreading    over them looked like the last traces of a dim embroidery.    The dome of the chapel, with its gilded cross, rose above    one wing, and the other ended in a conical pigeon-house,    above which the birds were flying, lustrous and slatey,    their breasts merged in the blue of the roof when they    dropped down on it.        ""And this is where you've been all these years.""        They turned away and began to walk down a long tunnel of    yellowing trees.  Benches with mossy feet stood against the    mossy edges of the path, and at its farther end it widened    into a circle about a basin rimmed with stone, in which the    opaque water strewn with leaves looked like a slab of gold-    flecked agate.  The path, growing narrower, wound on    circuitously through the woods, between slender serried    trunks twined with ivy. Patches of blue appeared above them    through the dwindling leaves, and presently the trees drew    back and showed the open fields along the river.        They walked on across the fields to the tow-path.  In a    curve of the wall some steps led up to a crumbling pavilion    with openings choked with ivy.  Anna and Darrow seated    themselves on the bench projecting from the inner wall of    the pavilion and looked across the river at the slopes    divided into blocks of green and fawn-colour, and at the    chalk-tinted village lifting its squat church-tower and grey    roofs against the precisely drawn lines of the landscape.    Anna sat silent, so intensely aware of Darrow's nearness    that there was no surprise in the touch he laid on her hand.    They looked at each other, and he smiled and said: ""There    are to be no more obstacles now.""        ""Obstacles?"" The word startled her.  ""What obstacles?""        ""Don't you remember the wording of the telegram that turned    me back last May?  'Unforeseen obstacle': that was it.  What    was the earth-shaking problem, by the way?  Finding a    governess for Effie, wasn't it?""        ""But I gave you my reason: the reason why it was an    obstacle.  I wrote you fully about it.""        ""Yes, I know you did.""  He lifted her hand and kissed it.    ""How far off it all seems, and how little it all matters    today!""        She looked at him quickly.  ""Do you feel that?  I suppose I'm    different.  I want to draw all those wasted months into    today--to make them a part of it.""        ""But they are, to me.  You reach back and take everything--    back to the first days of all.""        She frowned a little, as if struggling with an inarticulate    perplexity.  ""It's curious how, in those first days, too,    something that I didn't understand came between us.""        ""Oh, in those days we neither of us understood, did we?  It's    part of what's called the bliss of being young.""        ""Yes, I thought that, too: thought it, I mean, in looking    back.  But it couldn't, even then, have been as true of you    as of me; and now----""        ""Now,"" he said, ""the only thing that matters is that we're    sitting here together.""        He dismissed the rest with a lightness that might have    seemed conclusive evidence of her power over him.  But she    took no pride in such triumphs.  It seemed to her that she    wanted his allegiance and his adoration not so much for    herself as for their mutual love, and that in treating    lightly any past phase of their relation he took something    from its present beauty.  The colour rose to her face.        ""Between you and me everything matters.""        ""Of course!"" She felt the unperceiving sweetness of his    smile.  ""That's why,"" he went on, ""'everything,' for me, is    here and now: on this bench, between you and me.""        She caught at the phrase.  ""That's what I meant: it's here    and now; we can't get away from it.""        ""Get away from it?  Do you want to?  AGAIN?""        Her heart was beating unsteadily.  Something in her,    fitfully and with reluctance, struggled to free itself, but    the warmth of his nearness penetrated every sense as the    sunlight steeped the landscape.  Then, suddenly, she felt    that she wanted no less than the whole of her happiness.        ""'Again'?  But wasn't it YOU, the last time----?""        She paused, the tremor in her of Psyche holding up the lamp.    But in the interrogative light of her pause her companion's    features underwent no change.        ""The last time?  Last spring?  But it was you who--for the    best of reasons, as you've told me--turned me back from your    very door last spring!""        She saw that he was good-humouredly ready to ""thresh out,""    for her sentimental satisfaction, a question which, for his    own, Time had so conclusively dealt with; and the sense of    his readiness reassured her.        ""I wrote as soon as I could,"" she rejoined.  ""I explained    the delay and asked you to come.  And you never even    answered my letter.""        ""It was impossible to come then.  I had to go back to my    post.""        ""And impossible to write and tell me so?""        ""Your letter was a long time coming.  I had waited a week--    ten days.  I had some excuse for thinking, when it came,    that you were in no great hurry for an answer.""        ""You thought that--really--after reading it?""        ""I thought it.""        Her heart leaped up to her throat.  ""Then why are you here    today?""        He turned on her with a quick look of wonder.  ""God knows--    if you can ask me that!""        ""You see I was right to say I didn't understand.""        He stood up abruptly and stood facing her, blocking the view    over the river and the checkered slopes.  ""Perhaps I might    say so too.""        ""No, no: we must neither of us have any reason for saying it    again.""  She looked at him gravely.  ""Surely you and I    needn't arrange the lights before we show ourselves to each    other.  I want you to see me just as I am, with all my    irrational doubts and scruples; the old ones and the new    ones too.""        He came back to his seat beside her.  ""Never mind the old    ones.  They were justified--I'm willing to admit it.  With    the governess having suddenly to be packed off, and Effie on    your hands, and your mother-in-law ill, I see the    impossibility of your letting me come. I even see that, at    the moment, it was difficult to write and explain.  But what    does all that matter now?  The new scruples are the ones I    want to tackle.""        Again her heart trembled.  She felt her happiness so near,    so sure, that to strain it closer might be like a child's    crushing a pet bird in its caress.  But her very security    urged her on.  For so long her doubts had been knife-edged:    now they had turned into bright harmless toys that she could    toss and catch without peril!        ""You didn't come, and you didn't answer my letter; and after    waiting four months I wrote another.""    ""And I answered that one; and I'm here.""        ""Yes.""  She held his eyes.  ""But in my last letter I repeated    exactly what I'd said in the first--the one I wrote you last    June.  I told you then that I was ready to give you the    answer to what you'd asked me in London; and in telling you    that, I told you what the answer was.""        ""My dearest!  My dearest!"" Darrow murmured.        ""You ignored that letter.  All summer you made no sign. And    all I ask now is, that you should frankly tell me why.""        ""I can only repeat what I've just said.  I was hurt and    unhappy and I doubted you.  I suppose if I'd cared less I    should have been more confident.  I cared so much that I    couldn't risk another failure.  For you'd made me feel that    I'd miserably failed.  So I shut my eyes and set my teeth    and turned my back.  There's the whole pusillanimous truth    of it!""        ""Oh, if it's the WHOLE truth!----""  She let him clasp    her. ""There's my torment, you see.  I thought that was what    your silence meant till I made you break it.  Now I want to    be sure that I was right.""        ""What can I tell you to make you sure?""        ""You can let me tell YOU everything first.""  She drew    away, but without taking her hands from him.  ""Owen saw you    in Paris,"" she began.        She looked at him and he faced her steadily.  The light was    full on his pleasantly-browned face, his grey eyes, his    frank white forehead.  She noticed for the first time a    seal-ring in a setting of twisted silver on the hand he had    kept on hers.        ""In Paris?  Oh, yes...So he did.""        ""He came back and told me.  I think you talked to him a    moment in a theatre.  I asked if you'd spoken of my having    put you off--or if you'd sent me any message. He didn't    remember that you had.""        ""In a crush--in a Paris foyer?  My dear!""        ""It was absurd of me!  But Owen and I have always been on odd    kind of brother-and-sister terms.  I think he guessed about    us when he saw you with me in London. So he teased me a    little and tried to make me curious about you; and when he    saw he'd succeeded he told me he hadn't had time to say much    to you because you were in such a hurry to get back to the    lady you were with.""        He still held her hands, but she felt no tremor in his, and    the blood did not stir in his brown cheek.  He seemed to be    honestly turning over his memories.    ""Yes: and what else did he tell you?""        ""Oh, not much, except that she was awfully pretty.  When I    asked him to describe her he said you had her tucked away in    a baignoire and he hadn't actually seen her; but he saw the    tail of her cloak, and somehow knew from that that she was    pretty.  One DOES, you know...I think he said the cloak    was pink.""        Darrow broke into a laugh.  ""Of course it was--they always    are!  So that was at the bottom of your doubts?""        ""Not at first.  I only laughed.  But afterward, when I wrote    you and you didn't answer----Oh, you DO see?"" she    appealed to him.        He was looking at her gently.  ""Yes: I see.""        ""It's not as if this were a light thing between us.  I want    you to know me as I am.  If I thought that at that    moment...when you were on your way here, almost----""        He dropped her hand and stood up.  ""Yes, yes--I understand.""        ""But do you?"" Her look followed him.  ""I'm not a goose of a    girl.  I know...of course I KNOW...but there are things    a woman feels...when what she knows doesn't make any    difference.  It's not that I want you to explain--I mean    about that particular evening.  It's only that I want you to    have the whole of my feeling.  I didn't know what it was    till I saw you again.  I never dreamed I should say such    things to you!""        ""I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!"" He    turned back and lifting a floating end of her scarf put his    lips to it.  ""But now that you have, I know--I know,"" he    smiled down at her.        ""You know?""        ""That this is no light thing between us.  Now you may ask me    anything you please!  That was all I wanted to ask YOU.""        For a long moment they looked at each other without    speaking.  She saw the dancing spirit in his eyes turn grave    and darken to a passionate sternness.  He stooped and kissed    her, and she sat as if folded in wings.    "

Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time    at the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship    occasioned to the progress of his great work--the Key to all    Mythologies--naturally made him look forward the more eagerly    to the happy termination of courtship.  But he had deliberately    incurred the hindrance, having made up his mind that it was now time    for him to adorn his life with the graces of female companionship,    to irradiate the gloom which fatigue was apt to hang over the intervals    of studious labor with the play of female fancy, and to secure in this,    his culminating age, the solace of female tendance for his declining years.     Hence he determined to abandon himself to the stream of feeling,    and perhaps was surprised to find what an exceedingly shallow rill    it was.  As in droughty regions baptism by immersion could only be    performed symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found that sprinkling was    the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream would afford him;    and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated the force    of masculine passion.  Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure that    Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised    to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage.  It had once    or twice crossed his mind that possibly there, was some deficiency    in Dorothea to account for the moderation of his abandonment;    but he was unable to discern the deficiency, or to figure to himself    a woman who would have pleased him better; so that there was clearly    no reason to fall back upon but the exaggerations of human tradition.         ""Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?""    said Dorothea to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship;    ""could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton's    daughters did to their father, without understanding what they read?""        ""I fear that would be wearisome to you,"" said Mr. Casaubon, smiling;    ""and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have    mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground    for rebellion against the poet.""        ""Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they    would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second    place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to    understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting.     I hope you don't expect me to be naughty and stupid?""        ""I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every    possible relation of life.  Certainly it might be a great advantage    if you were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it    were well to begin with a little reading.""        Dorothea seized this as a precious permission.  She would not have    asked Mr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages, dreading of all    things to be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely    out of devotion to her future husband that she wished to know Latin    and Creek.  Those provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her    a standing-ground from which all truth could be seen more truly.     As it was, she constantly doubted her own conclusions, because she    felt her own ignorance: how could she be confident that one-roomed    cottages were not for the glory of God, when men who knew the classics    appeared to conciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal    for the glory?  Perhaps even Hebrew might be necessary--at least the    alphabet and a few roots--in order to arrive at the core of things,    and judge soundly on the social duties of the Christian.  And she    had not reached that point of renunciation at which she would have    been satisfier' with having a wise husband: she wished, poor child,    to be wise herself.  Miss Brooke was certainly very naive with al:    her alleged cleverness.  Celia, whose mind had never been thought    too powerful, saw the emptiness of other people's pretensions much    more readily.  To have in general but little feeling, seems to be    the only security against feeling too much on any particular occasion.         However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour together,    like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover,    to whom a mistress's elementary ignorance and difficulties have    a touching fitness.  Few scholars would have disliked teaching    the alphabet under such circumstances.  But Dorothea herself    was a little shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity,    and the answers she got to some timid questions about the value    of the Greek accents gave her a painful suspicion that here indeed    there might be secrets not capable of explanation to a woman's reason.         Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with    his usual strength upon it one day that he came into the library    while the reading was going forward.         ""Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics,    that kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman--too taxing, you know.""        ""Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,"" said Mr. Casaubon,    evading the question.  ""She had the very considerate thought    of saving my eyes.""        ""Ah, well, without understanding, you know--that may not be so bad.     But there is a lightness about the feminine mind--a touch and go--music,    the fine arts, that kind of thing--they should study those up    to a certain point, women should; but in a light way, you know.     A woman should be able to sit down and play you or sing you a good old    English tune.  That is what I like; though I have heard most things--been    at the opera in Vienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of that sort.     But I'm a conservative in music--it's not like ideas, you know.     I stick to the good old tunes.""        ""Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he is not,""    said Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and feminine    fine art must be forgiven her, considering the small tinkling    and smearing in which they chiefly consisted at that dark period.     She smiled and looked up at her betrothed with grateful eyes.     If he had always been asking her to play the ""Last Rose of Summer,""    she would have required much resignation.  ""He says there is only an old    harpsichord at Lowick, and it is covered with books.""        ""Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear.  Celia, now,    plays very prettily, and is always ready to play.  However,    since Casaubon does not like it, you are all right.  But it's    a pity you should not have little recreations of that sort,    Casaubon: the bow always strung--that kind of thing, you know--will not do.""        ""I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my    ears teased with measured noises,"" said Mr. Casaubon.  ""A tune much    iterated has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind    perform a sort of minuet to keep time--an effect hardly tolerable,    I imagine, after boyhood.  As to the grander forms of music,    worthy to accompany solemn celebrations, and even to serve as    an educating influence according to the ancient conception,    I say nothing, for with these we are not immediately concerned.""        ""No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,"" said Dorothea.     ""When we were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear    the great organ at Freiberg, and it made me sob.""        ""That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,"" said Mr. Brooke.     ""Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece    to take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?""        He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really    thinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married    to so sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.         ""It is wonderful, though,"" he said to himself as he shuffled out    of the room--""it is wonderful that she should have liked him.     However, the match is good.  I should have been travelling out of my    brief to have hindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will.     He is pretty certain to be a bishop, is Casaubon.  That was a very    seasonable pamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:--a deanery    at least.  They owe him a deanery.""        And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness,    by remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought    of the Radical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make    on the incomes of the bishops.  What elegant historian would    neglect a striking opportunity for pointing out that his heroes    did not foresee the history of the world, or even their own    actions?--For example, that Henry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby,    little thought of being a Catholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great,    when he measured his laborious nights with burning candles, had no    idea of future gentlemen measuring their idle days with watches.     Here is a mine of truth, which, however vigorously it may be worked,    is likely to outlast our coal.         But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted    by precedent--namely, that if he had foreknown his speech,    it might not have made any great difference.  To think with pleasure    of his niece's husband having a large ecclesiastical income was    one thing--to make a Liberal speech was another thing; and it is    a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.

Andersen,The Sunbeam And The Captive,"1872                        FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN                                      THE RACES                              by Hans Christian Andersen          A PRIZE, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, had   been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,- not in a single   race, but for the whole year.       ""I obtained the first prize,"" said the hare. ""Justice must still   be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the   prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second   prize, I consider almost an insult to myself""       ""No,"" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the   distribution of prizes; ""there should be some consideration for   industry and perseverance. I have heard many respectable people say   so, and I can quite understand it. The snail certainly took half a   year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself,   and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made. He gave himself up   entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was   all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the   second prize.""       ""I think I ought to have had some consideration too,"" said the   swallow. ""I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight   than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away.""       ""Yes, that is your misfortune,"" said the fence-rail; ""you are so   fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about into foreign   lands when the cold commences here. You have no love of fatherland   in you. There can be no consideration for you.""       ""But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor,"" said   the swallow, ""and suppose I slept the whole time, would that be   taken into account?""       ""Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen,"" said he, ""that you   have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be treated   with some consideration.""       ""I deserved the first prize, and not the second,"" said the   snail. ""I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from   cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay. I, on the   other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a   cripple in the service. If any one had a first prize, it ought to have   been myself. But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the   contrary, I despise it."" And the snail spat at them with contempt.       ""I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize- at least,   those for which I voted- was given with just and proper   consideration,"" said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a   member of the committee of judges. ""I always act with due order,   consideration, and calculation. Seven times have I already had the   honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote;   but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will.   I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the   beginning, and the second by going through from the end. Be so kind as   to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from   the beginning. The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H   for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize. The   eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore the   snail received the second prize. Next year, the letter I will have its   turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second.""       ""I should really have voted for myself,"" said the mule, ""if I   had not been one of the judges on the committee. Not only the rapidity   with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due   consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able   to draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor the   sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he   suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track,   thinking he has concealed himself. No; there is something else on   which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left   unnoticed. I mean that which mankind call the beautiful. It is on   the beautiful that I particularly fix my eyes. I observed the   well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure to me to observe how   long they are. It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my   childhood; and so I voted for the hare.""       ""Buz,"" said the fly; ""there, I'm not going to make a long   speech; but I wish to say something about hares. I have really   overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine in   front of a railway train. I often do so. One can then so easily   judge of one's own swiftness. Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs of   a young hare. He had been running a long time before the engine; he   had no idea that I was travelling there. At last he had to stop in his   career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; for I   set upon it. I left him lying there, and rode on farther. I call   that conquering him; but I do not want the prize.""       ""It really seems to me,"" thought the wild rose, though she did not   express her opinion aloud- it is not in her nature to do so,- though   it would have been quite as well if she had; ""it certainly seems to me   that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the first   prize. The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable   path from the sun to us. It arrives in such strength, that all   nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhale   fragrance in its presence. Our worshipful judges don't appear to   have noticed this at all. Were I the sunbeam, I would give each one of   them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and they are mad   enough already. I only hope,"" continued the rose, ""that peace may   reign in the wood. It is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and to   live; to live in story and in song. The sunbeam will outlive us all.""       ""What is the first prize?"" asked the earthworm, who had   overslept the time, and only now came up.       ""It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden,"" replied the   mule. ""I proposed that as one of the prizes. The hare most decidedly   must have it; and I, as an active and thoughtful member of the   committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of   advantage to him; so now he is provided for. The snail can now sit   on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine. He has also been   appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing. It is   worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the   thing men call a 'committee.' I must say I expect much in the   future; we have already made such a good beginning.""                                     THE END   .   "

242,History Of Animals,25,Aristotle,Book06,"CHAPTER 22        Who passes by this Road so late?            Arthur Clennam had made his unavailing expedition to Calais in the    midst of a great pressure of business.  A certain barbaric Power    with valuable possessions on the map of the world, had occasion for    the services of one or two engineers, quick in invention and    determined in execution: practical men, who could make the men and    means their ingenuity perceived to be wanted out of the best    materials they could find at hand; and who were as bold and fertile    in the adaptation of such materials to their purpose, as in the    conception of their purpose itself.  This Power, being a barbaric    one, had no idea of stowing away a great national object in a    Circumlocution Office, as strong wine is hidden from the light in    a cellar until its fire and youth are gone, and the labourers who    worked in the vineyard and pressed the grapes are dust.  With    characteristic ignorance, it acted on the most decided and    energetic notions of How to do it; and never showed the least    respect for, or gave any quarter to, the great political science,    How not to do it.  Indeed it had a barbarous way of striking the    latter art and mystery dead, in the person of any enlightened    subject who practised it.        Accordingly, the men who were wanted were sought out and found;    which was in itself a most uncivilised and irregular way of    proceeding.  Being found, they were treated with great confidence    and honour (which again showed dense political ignorance), and were    invited to come at once and do what they had to do.  In short, they    were regarded as men who meant to do it, engaging with other men    who meant it to be done.        Daniel Doyce was one of the chosen.  There was no foreseeing at    that time whether he would be absent months or years.  The    preparations for his departure, and the conscientious arrangement    for him of all the details and results of their joint business, had    necessitated labour within a short compass of time, which had    occupied Clennam day and night.  He had slipped across the water in    his first leisure, and had slipped as quickly back again for his    farewell interview with Doyce.        Him Arthur now showed, with pains and care, the state of their    gains and losses, responsibilities and prospects.  Daniel went    through it all in his patient manner, and admired it all    exceedingly.  He audited the accounts, as if they were a far more    ingenious piece of mechanism than he had ever constructed, and    afterwards stood looking at them, weighing his hat over his head by    the brims, as if he were absorbed in the contemplation of some    wonderful engine.        'It's all beautiful, Clennam, in its regularity and order.  Nothing    can be plainer.  Nothing can be better.'        'I am glad you approve, Doyce.  Now, as to the management of your    capital while you are away, and as to the conversion of so much of    it as the business may need from time to time--' His partner    stopped him.        'As to that, and as to everything else of that kind, all rests with    you.  You will continue in all such matters to act for both of us,    as you have done hitherto, and to lighten my mind of a load it is    much relieved from.'        'Though, as I often tell you,' returned Clennam, 'you unreasonably    depreciate your business qualities.'        'Perhaps so,' said Doyce, smiling.  'And perhaps not.  Anyhow, I    have a calling that I have studied more than such matters, and that    I am better fitted for.  I have perfect confidence in my partner,    and I am satisfied that he will do what is best.  If I have a    prejudice connected with money and money figures,' continued Doyce,    laying that plastic workman's thumb of his on the lapel of his    partner's coat, 'it is against speculating.  I don't think I have    any other.  I dare say I entertain that prejudice, only because I    have never given my mind fully to the subject.'        'But you shouldn't call it a prejudice,' said Clennam.  'My dear    Doyce, it is the soundest sense.'        'I am glad you think so,' returned Doyce, with his grey eye looking    kind and bright.        'It so happens,' said Clennam, 'that just now, not half an hour    before you came down, I was saying the same thing to Pancks, who    looked in here.  We both agreed that to travel out of safe    investments is one of the most dangerous, as it is one of the most    common, of those follies which often deserve the name of vices.'        'Pancks?' said Doyce, tilting up his hat at the back, and nodding    with an air of confidence.  'Aye, aye, aye!  That's a cautious    fellow.'        'He is a very cautious fellow indeed,' returned Arthur.  'Quite a    specimen of caution.'        They both appeared to derive a larger amount of satisfaction from    the cautious character of Mr Pancks, than was quite intelligible,    judged by the surface of their conversation.        'And now,' said Daniel, looking at his watch, 'as time and tide    wait for no man, my trusty partner, and as I am ready for starting,    bag and baggage, at the gate below, let me say a last word.  I want    you to grant a request of mine.'        'Any request you can make--Except,' Clennam was quick with his    exception, for his partner's face was quick in suggesting it,    'except that I will abandon your invention.'        'That's the request, and you know it is,' said Doyce.        'I say, No, then.  I say positively, No.  Now that I have begun, I    will have some definite reason, some responsible statement,    something in the nature of a real answer, from those people.'        'You will not,' returned Doyce, shaking his head.  'Take my word    for it, you never will.'        'At least, I'll try,' said Clennam.  'It will do me no harm to    try.'        'I am not certain of that,' rejoined Doyce, laying his hand    persuasively on his shoulder.  'It has done me harm, my friend.  It    has aged me, tired me, vexed me, disappointed me.  It does no man    any good to have his patience worn out, and to think himself ill-    used.  I fancy, even already, that unavailing attendance on delays    and evasions has made you something less elastic than you used to    be.'        'Private anxieties may have done that for the moment,' said    Clennam, 'but not official harrying.  Not yet.  I am not hurt yet.'        'Then you won't grant my request?'        'Decidedly, No,' said Clennam.  'I should be ashamed if I submitted    to be so soon driven out of the field, where a much older and a    much more sensitively interested man contended with fortitude so    long.'        As there was no moving him, Daniel Doyce returned the grasp of his    hand, and, casting a farewell look round the counting-house, went    down-stairs with him.  Doyce was to go to Southampton to join the    small staff of his fellow-travellers; and a coach was at the gate,    well furnished and packed, and ready to take him there.  The    workmen were at the gate to see him off, and were mightily proud of    him.  'Good luck to you, Mr Doyce!' said one of the number.     'Wherever you go, they'll find as they've got a man among 'em) a    man as knows his tools and as his tools knows, a man as is willing    and a man as is able, and if that's not a man, where is a man!'    This oration from a gruff volunteer in the back-ground, not    previously suspected of any powers in that way, was received with    three loud cheers; and the speaker became a distinguished character    for ever afterwards.  In the midst of the three loud cheers, Daniel    gave them all a hearty 'Good Bye, Men!' and the coach disappeared    from sight, as if the concussion of the air had blown it out of    Bleeding Heart Yard.        Mr Baptist, as a grateful little fellow in a position of trust, was    among the workmen, and had done as much towards the cheering as a    mere foreigner could.  In truth, no men on earth can cheer like    Englishmen, who do so rally one another's blood and spirit when    they cheer in earnest, that the stir is like the rush of their    whole history, with all its standards waving at once, from Saxon    Alfred's downwards.  Mr Baptist had been in a manner whirled away    before the onset, and was taking his breath in quite a scared    condition when Clennam beckoned him to follow up-stairs, and return    the books and papers to their places.        In the lull consequent on the departure--in that first vacuity    which ensues on every separation, foreshadowing the great    separation that is always overhanging all mankind--Arthur stood at    his desk, looking dreamily out at a gleam of sun.  But his    liberated attention soon reverted to the theme that was foremost in    his thoughts, and began, for the hundredth time, to dwell upon    every circumstance that had impressed itself upon his mind on the    mysterious night when he had seen the man at his mother's.  Again    the man jostled him in the crooked street, again he followed the    man and lost him, again he came upon the man in the court-yard    looking at the house, again he followed the man and stood beside    him on the door-steps.                 'Who passes by this road so late?              Compagnon de la Majolaine;         Who passes by this road so late?              Always gay!'            It was not the first time, by many, that he had recalled the song    of the child's game, of which the fellow had hummed @ verse while    they stood side by side; but he was so unconscious of having    repeated it audibly, that he started to hear the next verse.                 'Of all the king's knights 'tis the flower,              Compagnon de la Majolaine;         Of all the king's knights 'tis the flower,              Always gay!'            Cavalletto had deferentially suggested the words and tune,    supposing him to have stopped short for want of more.        'Ah!  You know the song, Cavalletto?'        'By Bacchus, yes, sir!  They all know it in France.  I have heard    it many times, sung by the little children.  The last time when it    I have heard,' said Mr Baptist, formerly Cavalletto, who usually    went back to his native construction of sentences when his memory    went near home, 'is from a sweet little voice.  A little voice,    very pretty, very innocent.  Altro!'        'The last time I heard it,' returned Arthur, 'was in a voice quite    the reverse of pretty, and quite the reverse of innocent.'  He said    it more to himself than to his companion, and added to himself,    repeating the man's next words.  'Death of my life, sir, it's my    character to be impatient!'        'EH!' cried Cavalletto, astounded, and with all his colour gone in    a moment.        'What is the matter?'        'Sir!  You know where I have heard that song the last time?'        With his rapid native action, his hands made the outline of a high    hook nose, pushed his eyes near together, dishevelled his hair,    puffed out his upper lip to represent a thick moustache, and threw    the heavy end of an ideal cloak over his shoulder.  While doing    this, with a swiftness incredible to one who has not watched an    Italian peasant, he indicated a very remarkable and sinister smile.        The whole change passed over him like a flash of light, and he    stood in the same instant, pale and astonished, before his patron.        'In the name of Fate and wonder,' said Clennam, 'what do you mean?     Do you know a man of the name of Blandois?'        'No!' said Mr Baptist, shaking his head.        'You have just now described a man who was by when you heard that    song; have you not?'        'Yes!' said Mr Baptist, nodding fifty times.        'And was he not called Blandois?'        'No!' said Mr Baptist.  'Altro, Altro, Altro, Altro!'  He could not    reject the name sufficiently, with his head and his right    forefinger going at once.        'Stay!' cried Clennam, spreading out the handbill on his desk.     'Was this the man?  You can understand what I read aloud?'        'Altogether.  Perfectly.'        'But look at it, too.  Come here and look over me, while I read.'        Mr Baptist approached, followed every word with his quick eyes, saw    and heard it all out with the greatest impatience, then clapped his    two hands flat upon the bill as if he had fiercely caught some    noxious creature, and cried, looking eagerly at Clennam, 'It is the    man!  Behold him!'        'This is of far greater moment to me' said Clennam, in great    agitation, 'than you can imagine.  Tell me where you knew the man.'        Mr Baptist, releasing the paper very slowly and with much    discomfiture, and drawing himself back two or three paces, and    making as though he dusted his hands, returned, very much against    his will:        'At Marsiglia--Marseilles.'        'What was he?'        'A prisoner, and--Altro!  I believe yes!--an,' Mr Baptist crept    closer again to whisper it, 'Assassin!'        Clennam fell back as if the word had struck him a blow: so terrible    did it make his mother's communication with the man appear.     Cavalletto dropped on one knee, and implored him, with a redundancy    of gesticulation, to hear what had brought himself into such foul    company.        He told with perfect truth how it had come of a little contraband    trading, and how he had in time been released from prison, and how    he had gone away from those antecedents.  How, at the house of    entertainment called the Break of Day at Chalons on the Saone, he    had been awakened in his bed at night by the same assassin, then    assuming the name of Lagnier, though his name had formerly been    Rigaud; how the assassin had proposed that they should join their    fortunes together; how he held the assassin in such dread and    aversion that he had fled from him at daylight, and how he had ever    since been haunted by the fear of seeing the assassin again and    being claimed by him as an acquaintance.  When he had related this,    with an emphasis and poise on the word, 'assassin,' peculiarly    belonging to his own language, and which did not serve to render it    less terrible to Clennam, he suddenly sprang to his feet, pounced    upon the bill again, and with a vehemence that would have been    absolute madness in any man of Northern origin, cried 'Behold the    same assassin!  Here he is!'        In his passionate raptures, he at first forgot the fact that he had    lately seen the assassin in London.  On his remembering it, it    suggested hope to Clennam that the recognition might be of later    date than the night of the visit at his mother's; but Cavalletto    was too exact and clear about time and place, to leave any opening    for doubt that it had preceded that occasion.        'Listen,' said Arthur, very seriously.  'This man, as we have read    here, has wholly disappeared.'        'Of it I am well content!' said Cavalletto, raising his eyes    piously.  'A thousand thanks to Heaven!  Accursed assassin!'        'Not so,' returned Clennam; 'for until something more is heard of    him, I can never know an hour's peace.'        'Enough, Benefactor; that is quite another thing.  A million of    excuses!'        'Now, Cavalletto,' said Clennam, gently turning him by the arm, so    that they looked into each other's eyes.  'I am certain that for    the little I have been able to do for you, you are the most    sincerely grateful of men.'        'I swear it!' cried the other.        'I know it.  If you could find this man, or discover what has    become of him, or gain any later intelligence whatever of him, you    would render me a service above any other service I could receive    in the world, and would make me (with far greater reason) as    grateful to you as you are to me.'    'I know not where to look,' cried the little man, kissing Arthur's    hand in a transport.  'I know not where to begin.  I know not where    to go.  But, courage!  Enough!  It matters not!  I go, in this    instant of time!'        'Not a word to any one but me, Cavalletto.'        'Al-tro!' cried Cavalletto.  And was gone with great speed.    "
243,History Of Roman-1,64,Edward Gibbon  ,Chapter11,"Chapter 10        SCOUTS OUT            'And so, Miss Wren,' said Mr Eugene Wrayburn, 'I cannot    persuade you to dress me a doll?'        'No,' replied Miss Wren snappishly; 'if you want one, go and buy    one at the shop.'        'And my charming young goddaughter,' said Mr Wrayburn    plaintively, 'down in Hertfordshire--'        ('Humbugshire you mean, I think,' interposed Miss Wren.)        '--is to be put upon the cold footing of the general public, and is to    derive no advantage from my private acquaintance with the Court    Dressmaker?'        'If it's any advantage to your charming godchild--and oh, a    precious godfather she has got!'--replied Miss Wren, pricking at    him in the air with her needle, 'to be informed that the Court    Dressmaker knows your tricks and your manners, you may tell her    so by post, with my compliments.'        Miss Wren was busy at her work by candle-light, and Mr    Wrayburn, half amused and half vexed, and all idle and shiftless,    stood by her bench looking on.  Miss Wren's troublesome child    was in the corner in deep disgrace, and exhibiting great    wretchedness in the shivering stage of prostration from drink.        'Ugh, you disgraceful boy!' exclaimed Miss Wren, attracted by the    sound of his chattering teeth, 'I wish they'd all drop down your    throat and play at dice in your stomach!  Boh, wicked child!  Bee-    baa, black sheep!'        On her accompanying each of these reproaches with a threatening    stamp of the foot, the wretched creature protested with a whine.        'Pay five shillings for you indeed!' Miss Wren proceeded; 'how    many hours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings, you    imfamous boy?--Don't cry like that, or I'll throw a doll at you.  Pay    five shillings fine for you indeed.  Fine in more ways than one, I    think!  I'd give the dustman five shillings, to carry you off in the    dust cart.'        'No, no,' pleaded the absurd creature.  'Please!'        'He's enough to break his mother's heart, is this boy,' said Miss    Wren, half appealing to Eugene.  'I wish I had never brought him    up.  He'd be sharper than a serpent's tooth, if he wasn't as dull as    ditch water.  Look at him.  There's a pretty object for a parent's    eyes!'        Assuredly, in his worse than swinish state (for swine at least fatten    on their guzzling, and make themselves good to eat), he was a    pretty object for any eyes.        'A muddling and a swipey old child,' said Miss Wren, rating him    with great severity, 'fit for nothing but to be preserved in the liquor    that destroys him, and put in a great glass bottle as a sight for other    swipey children of his own pattern,--if he has no consideration for    his liver, has he none for his mother?'        'Yes.  Deration, oh don't!' cried the subject of these angry remarks.        'Oh don't and oh don't,' pursued Miss Wren.  'It's oh do and oh do.    And why do you?'        'Won't do so any more.  Won't indeed.  Pray!'        'There!' said Miss Wren, covering her eyes with her hand.  'I can't    bear to look at you.  Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl.    Make yourself useful in some way, bad boy, and let me have your    room instead of your company, for one half minute.'        Obeying her, he shambled out, and Eugene Wrayburn saw the    tears exude from between the little creature's fingers as she kept    her hand before her eyes.  He was sorry, but his sympathy did not    move his carelessness to do anything but feel sorry.        'I'm going to the Italian Opera to try on,' said Miss Wren, taking    away her hand after a little while, and laughing satirically to hide    that she had been crying; 'I must see your back before I go, Mr    Wrayburn.  Let me first tell you, once for all, that it's of no use your    paying visits to me.  You wouldn't get what you want, of me, no,    not if you brought pincers with you to tear it out.'        'Are you so obstinate on the subject of a doll's dress for my    godchild?'        'Ah!' returned Miss Wren with a hitch of her chin, 'I am so    obstinate.  And of course it's on the subject of a doll's dress--or    ADdress--whichever you like.  Get along and give it up!'        Her degraded charge had come back, and was standing behind her    with the bonnet and shawl.        'Give 'em to me and get back into your corner, you naughty old    thing!' said Miss Wren, as she turned and espied him.  'No, no, I    won't have your help.  Go into your corner, this minute!'        The miserable man, feebly rubbing the back of his faltering hands    downward from the wrists, shuffled on to his post of disgrace; but    not without a curious glance at Eugene in passing him,    accompanied with what seemed as if it might have been an action    of his elbow, if any action of any limb or joint he had, would have    answered truly to his will.  Taking no more particular notice of him    than instinctively falling away from the disagreeable contact,    Eugene, with a lazy compliment or so to Miss Wren, begged leave    to light his cigar, and departed.        'Now you prodigal old son,' said Jenny, shaking her head and her    emphatic little forefinger at her burden, 'you sit there till I come    back.  You dare to move out of your corner for a single instant    while I'm gone, and I'll know the reason why.'        With this admonition, she blew her work candles out, leaving him    to the light of the fire, and, taking her big door-key in her pocket    and her crutch-stick in her hand, marched off.        Eugene lounged slowly towards the Temple, smoking his cigar,    but saw no more of the dolls' dressmaker, through the accident of    their taking opposite sides of the street.  He lounged along    moodily, and stopped at Charing Cross to look about him, with as    little interest in the crowd as any man might take, and was    lounging on again, when a most unexpected object caught his eyes.    No less an object than Jenny Wren's bad boy trying to make up his    mind to cross the road.        A more ridiculous and feeble spectacle than this tottering wretch    making unsteady sallies into the roadway, and as often staggering    back again, oppressed by terrors of vehicles that were a long way    off or were nowhere, the streets could not have shown.  Over and    over again, when the course was perfectly clear, he set out, got half    way, described a loop, turned, and went back again; when he    might have crossed and re-crossed half a dozen times.  Then, he    would stand shivering on the edge of the pavement, looking up the    street and looking down, while scores of people jostled him, and    crossed, and went on.  Stimulated in course of time by the sight of    so many successes, he would make another sally, make another    loop, would all but have his foot on the opposite pavement, would    see or imagine something coming, and would stagger back again.    There, he would stand making spasmodic preparations as if for a    great leap, and at last would decide on a start at precisely the    wrong moment, and would be roared at by drivers, and would    shrink back once more, and stand in the old spot shivering, with    the whole of the proceedings to go through again.        'It strikes me,' remarked Eugene coolly, after watching him for    some minutes, 'that my friend is likely to be rather behind time if    he has any appointment on hand.'  With which remark he strolled    on, and took no further thought of him.        Lightwood was at home when he got to the Chambers, and had    dined alone there.  Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was    having his wine and reading the evening paper, and brought a    glass, and filled it for good fellowship's sake.        'My dear Mortimer, you are the express picture of contented    industry, reposing (on credit) after the virtuous labours of the day.'        'My dear Eugene, you are the express picture of discontented    idleness not reposing at all.  Where have you been?'        'I have been,' replied Wrayburn, '--about town.  I have turned up at    the present juncture, with the intention of consulting my highly    intelligent and respected solicitor on the position of my affairs.'        'Your highly intelligent and respect solicitor is of opinion that your    affairs are in a bad way, Eugene.'        'Though whether,' said Eugene thoughtfully, 'that can be    intelligently said, now, of the affairs of a client who has nothing to    lose and who cannot possibly be made to pay, may be open to    question.'        'You have fallen into the hands of the Jews, Eugene.'        'My dear boy,' returned the debtor, very composedly taking up his    glass, 'having previously fallen into the hands of some of the    Christians, I can bear it with philosophy.'        'I have had an interview to-day, Eugene, with a Jew, who seems    determined to press us hard.  Quite a Shylock, and quite a    Patriarch.  A picturesque grey-headed and grey-bearded old Jew, in    a shovel-hat and gaberdine.'        'Not,' said Eugene, pausing in setting down his glass, 'surely not    my worthy friend Mr Aaron?'        'He calls himself Mr Riah.'        'By-the-by,' said Eugene, 'it comes into my mind that--no doubt    with an instinctive desire to receive him into the bosom of our    Church--I gave him the name of Aaron!'        'Eugene, Eugene,' returned Lightwood, 'you are more ridiculous    than usual.  Say what you mean.'        'Merely, my dear fellow, that I have the honour and pleasure of a    speaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe, and    that I address him as Mr Aaron, because it appears to me Hebraic,    expressive, appropriate, and complimentary.  Notwithstanding    which strong reasons for its being his name, it may not be his    name.'        'I believe you are the absurdest man on the face of the earth,' said    Lightwood, laughing.        'Not at all, I assure you.  Did he mention that he knew me?'        'He did not.  He only said of you that he expected to be paid by    you.'        'Which looks,' remarked Eugene with much gravity, 'like NOT    knowing me.  I hope it may not be my worthy friend Mr Aaron,    for, to tell you the truth, Mortimer, I doubt he may have a    prepossession against me.  I strongly suspect him of having had a    hand in spiriting away Lizzie.'        'Everything,' returned Lightwood impatiently, 'seems, by a fatality,    to bring us round to Lizzie.  ""About town"" meant about Lizzie, just    now, Eugene.'        'My solicitor, do you know,' observed Eugene, turning round to the    furniture, 'is a man of infinite discernment!'        'Did it not, Eugene?'        'Yes it did, Mortimer.'        'And yet, Eugene, you know you do not really care for her.'        Eugene Wrayburn rose, and put his hands in his pockets, and stood    with a foot on the fender, indolently rocking his body and looking    at the fire.  After a prolonged pause, he replied: 'I don't know that.    I must ask you not to say that, as if we took it for granted.'        'But if you do care for her, so much the more should you leave her    to herself.'        Having again paused as before, Eugene said: 'I don't know that,    either.  But tell me.  Did you ever see me take so much trouble    about anything, as about this disappearance of hers?  I ask, for    information.'        'My dear Eugene, I wish I ever had!'        'Then you have not?  Just so.  You confirm my own impression.    Does that look as if I cared for her?  I ask, for information.'        'I asked YOU for information, Eugene,' said Mortimer    reproachfully.        'Dear boy, I know it, but I can't give it.  I thirst for information.    What do I mean?  If my taking so much trouble to recover her does    not mean that I care for her, what does it mean?  ""If Peter Piper    picked a peck of pickled pepper, where's the peck,"" &c.?'        Though he said this gaily, he said it with a perplexed and    inquisitive face, as if he actually did not know what to make of    himself.  'Look on to the end--' Lightwood was beginning to    remonstrate, when he caught at the words:        'Ah!  See now!  That's exactly what I am incapable of doing.  How    very acute you are, Mortimer, in finding my weak place!  When we    were at school together, I got up my lessons at the last moment,    day by day and bit by bit; now we are out in life together, I get up    my lessons in the same way.  In the present task I have not got    beyond this:--I am bent on finding Lizzie, and I mean to find her,    and I will take any means of finding her that offer themselves.  Fair    means or foul means, are all alike to me.  I ask you--for    information--what does that mean?  When I have found her I may    ask you--also for information--what do I mean now?  But it would    be premature in this stage, and it's not the character of my mind.'        Lightwood was shaking his head over the air with which his friend    held forth thus--an air so whimsically open and argumentative as    almost to deprive what he said of the appearance of evasion--when    a shuffling was heard at the outer door, and then an undecided    knock, as though some hand were groping for the knocker.  'The    frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood,' said Eugene, 'whom I    should be delighted to pitch from this elevation into the churchyard    below, without any intermediate ceremonies, have probably turned    the lamp out.  I am on duty to-night, and will see to the door.'        His friend had barely had time to recall the unprecedented gleam of    determination with which he had spoken of finding this girl, and    which had faded out of him with the breath of the spoken words,    when Eugene came back, ushering in a most disgraceful shadow of    a man, shaking from head to foot, and clothed in shabby grease    and smear.        'This interesting gentleman,' said Eugene, 'is the son--the    occasionally rather trying son, for he has his failings--of a lady of    my acquaintance.  My dear Mortimer--Mr Dolls.'  Eugene had no    idea what his name was, knowing the little dressmaker's to be    assumed, but presented him with easy confidence under the first    appellation that his associations suggested.        'I gather, my dear Mortimer,' pursued Eugene, as Lightwood stared    at the obscene visitor, 'from the manner of Mr Dolls--which is    occasionally complicated--that he desires to make some    communication to me.  I have mentioned to Mr Dolls that you and    I are on terms of confidence, and have requested Mr Dolls to    develop his views here.'        The wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what    remained of his hat, Eugene airily tossed it to the door, and put him    down in a chair.        'It will be necessary, I think,' he observed, 'to wind up Mr Dolls,    before anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him.    Brandy, Mr Dolls, or--?'        'Threepenn'orth Rum,' said Mr Dolls.        A judiciously small quantity of the spirit was given him in a wine-    glass, and he began to convey it to his mouth, with all kinds of    falterings and gyrations on the road.        'The nerves of Mr Dolls,' remarked Eugene to Lightwood, 'are    considerably unstrung.  And I deem it on the whole expedient to    fumigate Mr Dolls.'        He took the shovel from the grate, sprinkled a few live ashes on it,    and from a box on the chimney-piece took a few pastiles, which he    set upon them; then, with great composure began placidly waving    the shovel in front of Mr Dolls, to cut him off from his company.        'Lord bless my soul, Eugene!' cried Lightwood, laughing again,    'what a mad fellow you are!  Why does this creature come to see    you?'        'We shall hear,' said Wrayburn, very observant of his face withal.    'Now then.  Speak out.  Don't be afraid.  State your business,    Dolls.'        'Mist Wrayburn!' said the visitor, thickly and huskily. '--'TIS Mist    Wrayburn, ain't?'  With a stupid stare.        'Of course it is.  Look at me.  What do you want?'        Mr Dolls collapsed in his chair, and faintly said 'Threepenn'orth    Rum.'        'Will you do me the favour, my dear Mortimer, to wind up Mr    Dolls again?' said Eugene.  'I am occupied with the fumigation.'        A similar quantity was poured into his glass, and he got it to his    lips by similar circuitous ways.  Having drunk it, Mr Dolls, with    an evident fear of running down again unless he made haste,    proceeded to business.        'Mist Wrayburn.  Tried to nudge you, but you wouldn't.  You want    that drection.  You want t'know where she lives.  DO you Mist    Wrayburn?'        With a glance at his friend, Eugene replied to the question sternly,    'I do.'        'I am er man,' said Mr Dolls, trying to smite himself on the breast,    but bringing his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye, 'er do it.    I am er man er do it.'        'What are you the man to do?' demanded Eugene, still sternly.        'Er give up that drection.'        'Have you got it?'        With a most laborious attempt at pride and dignity, Mr Dolls    rolled his head for some time, awakening the highest expectations,    and then answered, as if it were the happiest point that could    possibly be expected of him: 'No.'        'What do you mean then?'        Mr Dolls, collapsing in the drowsiest manner after his late    intellectual triumph, replied: 'Threepenn'orth Rum.'        'Wind him up again, my dear Mortimer,' said Wrayburn; 'wind him    up again.'        'Eugene, Eugene,' urged Lightwood in a low voice, as he complied,    'can you stoop to the use of such an instrument as this?'        'I said,' was the reply, made with that former gleam of    determination, 'that I would find her out by any means, fair or foul.    These are foul, and I'll take them--if I am not first tempted to break    the head of Mr Dolls with the fumigator.  Can you get the    direction?  Do you mean that?  Speak!  If that's what you have    come for, say how much you want.'        'Ten shillings--Threepenn'orths Rum,' said Mr Dolls.        'You shall have it.'        'Fifteen shillings--Threepenn'orths Rum,' said Mr Dolls, making an    attempt to stiffen himself.        'You shall have it.  Stop at that.  How will you get the direction you    talk of?'        'I am er man,' said Mr Dolls, with majesty, 'er get it, sir.'        'How will you get it, I ask you?'        'I am ill-used vidual,' said Mr Dolls.  'Blown up morning t'night.    Called names.  She makes Mint money, sir, and never stands    Threepenn'orth Rum.'        'Get on,' rejoined Eugene, tapping his palsied head with the fire-    shovel, as it sank on his breast.  'What comes next?'        Making a dignified attempt to gather himself together, but, as it    were, dropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain    to pick up one, Mr Dolls, swaying his head from side to side,    regarded his questioner with what he supposed to be a haughty    smile and a scornful glance.        'She looks upon me as mere child, sir.  I am NOT mere child, sir.    Man.  Man talent.  Lerrers pass betwixt 'em.  Postman lerrers.    Easy for man talent er get drection, as get his own drection.'        'Get it then,' said Eugene; adding very heartily under his breath,    '--You Brute!  Get it, and bring it here to me, and earn the money for    sixty threepenn'orths of rum, and drink them all, one a top of    another, and drink yourself dead with all possible expedition.'  The    latter clauses of these special instructions he addressed to the fire,    as he gave it back the ashes he had taken from it, and replaced the    shovel.        Mr Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he    had been insulted by Lightwood, and stated his desire to 'have it    out with him' on the spot, and defied him to come on, upon the    liberal terms of a sovereign to a halfpenny.  Mr Dolls then fell a    crying, and then exhibited a tendency to fall asleep.  This last    manifestation as by far the most alarming, by reason of its    threatening his prolonged stay on the premises, necessitated    vigorous measures.  Eugene picked up his worn-out hat with the    tongs, clapped it on his head, and, taking him by the collar--all this    at arm's length--conducted him down stairs and out of the precincts    into Fleet Street.  There, he turned his face westward, and left him.        When he got back, Lightwood was standing over the fire, brooding    in a sufficiently low-spirited manner.        'I'll wash my hands of Mr Dolls  physically--' said Eugene, 'and be    with you again directly, Mortimer.'        'I would much prefer,' retorted Mortimer, 'your washing your hands    of Mr Dolls, morally, Eugene.'        'So would I,' said Eugene; 'but you see, dear boy, I can't do without    him.'        In a minute or two he resumed his chair, as perfectly unconcerned    as usual, and rallied his friend on having so narrowly escaped the    prowess of their muscular visitor.        'I can't be amused on this theme,' said Mortimer, restlessly.  'You    can make almost any theme amusing to me, Eugene, but not this.'        'Well!' cried Eugene, 'I am a little ashamed of it myself, and    therefore let us change the subject.'        'It is so deplorably underhanded,' said Mortimer.  'It is so unworthy    of you, this setting on of such a shameful scout.'        'We have changed the subject!' exclaimed Eugene, airily.  'We have    found a new one in that word, scout.  Don't be like Patience on a    mantelpiece frowning at Dolls, but sit down, and I'll tell you    something that you really will find amusing.  Take a cigar.  Look    at this of mine.  I light it--draw one puff--breathe the smoke out--    there it goes--it's Dolls!--it's gone--and being gone you are a man    again.'        'Your subject,' said Mortimer, after lighting a cigar, and    comforting himself with a whiff or two, 'was scouts, Eugene.'        'Exactly.  Isn't it droll that I never go out after dark, but I find    myself attended, always by one scout, and often by two?'        Lightwood took his cigar from his lips in surprise, and looked at    his friend, as if with a latent suspicion that there must be a jest or    hidden meaning in his words.        'On my honour, no,' said Wrayburn, answering the look and    smiling carelessly; 'I don't wonder at your supposing so, but on my    honour, no.  I say what I mean.  I never go out after dark, but I find    myself in the ludicrous situation of being followed and observed at    a distance, always by one scout, and often by two.'        'Are you sure, Eugene?'        'Sure?  My dear boy, they are always the same.'        'But there's no process out against you.  The Jews only threaten.    They have done nothing.  Besides, they know where to find you,    and I represent you.  Why take the trouble?'        'Observe the legal mind!' remarked Eugene, turning round to the    furniture again, with an air of indolent rapture.  'Observe the dyer's    hand, assimilating itself to what it works in,--or would work in, if    anybody would give it anything to do.  Respected solicitor, it's not    that.  The schoolmaster's abroad.'        'The schoolmaster?'        'Ay!  Sometimes the schoolmaster and the pupil are both abroad.    Why, how soon you rust in my absence!  You don't understand yet?    Those fellows who were here one night.  They are the scouts I    speak of, as doing me the honour to attend me after dark.'        'How long has this been going on?' asked Lightwood, opposing a    serious face to the laugh of his friend.        'I apprehend it has been going on, ever since a certain person went    off.  Probably, it had been going on some little time before I    noticed it: which would bring it to about that time.'        'Do you think they suppose you to have inveigled her away?'        'My dear Mortimer, you know the absorbing nature of my    professional occupations; I really have not had leisure to think    about it.'        'Have you asked them what they want?  Have you objected?'        'Why should I ask them what they want, dear fellow, when I am    indifferent what they want?  Why should I express objection, when    I don't object?'        'You are in your most reckless mood.  But you called the situation    just now, a ludicrous one; and most men object to that, even those    who are utterly indifferent to everything else.'        'You charm me, Mortimer, with your reading of my weaknesses.    (By-the-by, that very word, Reading, in its critical use, always    charms me.  An actress's Reading of a chambermaid, a dancer's    Reading of a hornpipe, a singer's Reading of a song, a marine    painter's Reading of the sea, the kettle-drum's Reading of an    instrumental passage, are phrases ever youthful and delightful.)  I    was mentioning your perception of my weaknesses.  I own to the    weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous position, and therefore    I transfer the position to the scouts.'        'I wish, Eugene, you would speak a little more soberly and plainly,    if it were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than    you do.'        'Then soberly and plainly, Mortimer, I goad the schoolmaster to    madness.  I make the schoolmaster so ridiculous, and so aware of    being made ridiculous, that I see him chafe and fret at every pore    when we cross one another.  The amiable occupation has been the    solace of my life, since I was baulked in the manner unnecessary to    recall.  I have derived inexpressible comfort from it.  I do it thus: I    stroll out after dark, stroll a little way, look in at a window and    furtively look out for the schoolmaster.  Sooner or later, I perceive    the schoolmaster on the watch; sometimes accompanied by his    hopeful pupil; oftener, pupil-less.  Having made sure of his    watching me, I tempt him on, all over London.  One night I go    east, another night north, in a few nights I go all round the    compass.  Sometimes, I walk; sometimes, I proceed in cabs,    draining the pocket of the schoolmaster who then follows in cabs.    I study and get up abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the    day.  With Venetian mystery I seek those No Thoroughfares at    night, glide into them by means of dark courts, tempt the    schoolmaster to follow, turn suddenly, and catch him before he can    retreat.  Then we face one another, and I pass him as unaware of    his existence, and he undergoes grinding torments.  Similarly, I    walk at a great pace down a short street, rapidly turn the corner,    and, getting out of his view, as rapidly turn back.  I catch him    coming on post, again pass him as unaware of his existence, and    again he undergoes grinding torments.  Night after night his    disappointment is acute, but hope springs eternal in the scholastic    breast, and he follows me again to-morrow.  Thus I enjoy the    pleasures of the chase, and derive great benefit from the healthful    exercise.  When I do not enjoy the pleasures of the chase, for    anything I know he watches at the Temple Gate all night.'        'This is an extraordinary story,' observed Lightwood, who had    heard it out with serious attention.  'I don't like it.'        'You are a little hipped, dear fellow,' said Eugene; 'you have been    too sedentary.  Come and enjoy the pleasures of the chase.'        'Do you mean that you believe he is watching now?'        'I have not the slightest doubt he is.'        'Have you seen him to-night?'        'I forgot to look for him when I was last out,' returned Eugene with    the calmest indifference; 'but I dare say he was there.  Come!  Be a    British sportsman and enjoy the pleasures of the chase.  It will do    you good.'        Lightwood hesitated; but, yielding to his curiosity, rose.        'Bravo!' cried Eugene, rising too.  'Or, if Yoicks would be in better    keeping, consider that I said Yoicks.  Look to your feet, Mortimer,    for we shall try your boots.  When you are ready, I am--need I say    with a Hey Ho Chivey, and likewise with a Hark Forward, Hark    Forward, Tantivy?'        'Will nothing make you serious?' said Mortimer, laughing through    his gravity.        'I am always serious, but just now I am a little excited by the    glorious fact that a southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a    hunting evening.  Ready?  So.  We turn out the lamp and shut the    door, and take the field.'        As the two friends passed out of the Temple into the public street,    Eugene demanded with a show of courteous patronage in which    direction Mortimer would you like the run to be?  'There is a rather    difficult country about Bethnal Green,' said Eugene, 'and we have    not taken in that direction lately.  What is your opinion of Bethnal    Green?'  Mortimer assented to Bethnal Green, and they turned    eastward.  'Now, when we come to St Paul's churchyard,' pursued    Eugene, 'we'll loiter artfully, and I'll show you the schoolmaster.'    But, they both saw him, before they got there; alone, and stealing    after them in the shadow of the houses, on the opposite side of the    way.        'Get your wind,' said Eugene, 'for I am off directly.  Does it occur    to you that the boys of Merry England will begin to deteriorate in    an educational light, if this lasts long?  The schoolmaster can't    attend to me and the boys too.  Got your wind?  I am off!'        At what a rate he went, to breathe the schoolmaster; and how he    then lounged and loitered, to put his patience to another kind of    wear; what preposterous ways he took, with no other object on    earth than to disappoint and punish him; and how he wore him out    by every piece of ingenuity that his eccentric humour could devise;    all this Lightwood noted, with a feeling of astonishment that so    careless a man could be so wary, and that so idle a man could take    so much trouble.  At last, far on in the third hour of the pleasures    of the chase, when he had brought the poor dogging wretch round    again into the City, he twisted Mortimer up a few dark entries,    twisted him into a little square court, twisted him sharp round    again, and they almost ran against Bradley Headstone.        'And you see, as I was saying, Mortimer,' remarked Eugene aloud    with the utmost coolness, as though there were no one within    hearing by themselves: 'and you see, as I was saying--undergoing    grinding torments.'        It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion.  Looking like the    hunted and not the hunter, baffled, worn, with the exhaustion of    deferred hope and consuming hate and anger in his face, white-    lipped, wild-eyed, draggle-haired, seamed with jealousy and anger,    and torturing himself with the conviction that he showed it all and    they exulted in it, he went by them in the dark, like a haggard head    suspended in the air: so completely did the force of his expression    cancel his figure.        Mortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man,    but this face impressed him.  He spoke of it more than once on the    remainder of the way home, and more than once when they got    home.        They had been abed in their respective rooms two or three hours,    when Eugene was partly awakened by hearing a footstep going    about, and was fully awakened by seeing Lightwood standing at    his bedside.        'Nothing wrong, Mortimer?'        'No.'        'What fancy takes you, then, for walking about in the night?'        'I am horribly wakeful.'        'How comes that about, I wonder!'        'Eugene, I cannot lose sight of that fellow's face.'        'Odd!' said Eugene with a light laugh, 'I can.'  And turned over,    and fell asleep again.  "
275,Jane Eyre,48,Charlotte Bronte,Chapter29,"Chapter 8        A Lunar Morning        The harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and white of scenery had altogether    disappeared. The glare of the sun had taken upon itself a faint tinge of    amber; the shadows upon the cliff of the crater wall were deeply purple.    To the eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and sheltered from the    sunrise, but to the westward the sky was blue and clear. I began to    realise the length of my insensibility.        We were no longer in a void. An atmosphere had arisen about us. The    outline of things had gained in character, had grown acute and varied;    save for a shadowed space of white substance here and there, white    substance that was no longer air but snow, the arctic appearance had gone    altogether. Everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and tumbled earth    spread to the blaze of the sun. Here and there at the edge of the    snowdrifts were transient little pools and eddies of water, the only    things stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sunlight inundated the    upper two blinds of our sphere and turned our climate to high summer, but    our feet were still in shadow, and the sphere was lying upon a drift of    snow.        And scattered here and there upon the slope, and emphasised by little    white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like    sticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which    they lay. That caught one's thoughts sharply.  Sticks! On a lifeless    world? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their    substance, I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture,    like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine    trees.        ""Cavor! "" I said.        ""Yes.""        ""It may be a dead world now - but once -""        Something arrested my attention. I had discovered among these needles a    number of little round objects.  And it seemed to me that one of these had    moved.  ""Cavor,"" I whispered.        ""What?""        But I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous.  For an instant I    could not believe my eyes. I gave an inarticulate cry. I gripped his arm.    I pointed.  ""Look!"" I cried, finding my tongue. ""There! Yes!  And there!""        His eyes followed my pointing finger. ""Eh?"" he said.        How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so petty a thing to state, and    yet it seemed so wonderful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that    amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded bodies, these little oval    bodies that might have passed as very small pebbles. And now first one and    then another had stirred, had rolled over and cracked, and down the crack    of each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting outward    to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-risen sun. For a moment that    was all, and then there stirred, and burst a third!        ""It is a seed,"" said Cavor. And then I heard him whisper very softly,    ""Life!""        ""Life!"" And immediately it poured upon us that our vast journey had not    been made in vain, that we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but to a    world that lived and moved! We watched intensely. I remember I kept    rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve, jealous of the faintest    suspicion of mist.        The picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field. All about    that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted b~ the    curvature of the glass. But we could see enough! One after another all    down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and gaped    apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of fruits; opened eager mouths.    that drank in the heat and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen    sun.        Every moment more of these seed coats ruptured, and even as they did so    the swelling pioneers overflowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and    passed into the second stage of growth. With a steady assurance, a swift    deliberation, these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to the earth    and a queer little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while the    whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets standing at attention in the    blaze of the sun.        They did not stand for long. The bundle-like buds swelled and strained and    opened with a jerk, thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips,    spreading a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that lengthened    rapidly, lengthened visibly even as we watched. The movement was slower    than any animal's, swifter than any plant's I have ever seen before. How    can I suggest it to you - the way that growth went on? The leaf tips grew    so that they moved onward even while we looked at them. The brown    seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity. Have you    ever on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched the    little thread of mercury creep up the tube? These moon plants grew like    that.        In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the more forward of these    plants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second    whorl of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so recently a lifeless    stretch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive-green herbage of    bristling spikes that swayed with the vigour of their growing.        I turned about, and behold! along the upper edge of a rock to the eastward    a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent,    dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And beyond this fringe was the    silhouette of a plant mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swelling    visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air.        Then to the westward also I discovered that another such distended form    was rising over the scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides,    and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue It rose as one    watched it; if one looked away from it for a minute and then back, its    outline had changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches until in a    little time it rose a coralline shape of many feet in height.  Compared    with such a growth the terrestrial puff-ball, which will sometimes swell a    foot in diameter in a single night, would be a hopeless laggard. But then    the puff-ball grows against a gravitational pull six times that of the    moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that had been hidden from us, but    not from the quickening sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a    bristling beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining into view,    hurrying tumultuously to tale advantage of the brief day in which it must    flower and fruit and seed again and die. It was like a miracle, that    growth. So, one must imagine, the trees and plants arose at the Creation    and covered the desolation of the new-made earth.        Imagine it; Imagine that dawn! The resurrection of the frozen air, the    stirring and quickening of the soil, and then this silent uprising of    vegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and spikes. Conceive it    all lit by a blaze that would make the intensest sunlight of earth seem    watery and weak. And still around this stirring jungle, wherever there was    shadow, lingered banks of bluish snow. And to have the picture of our    impression complete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all through a    thick bent glass, distorting it as things are distorted by a lens, acute    only in the centre of the picture, and very bright there, and towards the    edges magnified and unreal.    "
299,King Solomon's Mines,112,H.rider Haggard,Chap12,"The Moonstone: First Period, Chapter 5   [Previous Chapter] [Table  of Contents]       CHAPTER V  THE first thing I did, after we were left together  alone, was to make a third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand.  Mr. Franklin stopped me.    `There is one advantage about this horrid place,' he said; `we have  got it all to ourselves. Stay where you are, Betteredge; I have something  to say to you.'    While he was speaking, I was looking at him, and trying to see something  of the boy I remembered, in the man before me. The man put me out. Look  as I might, I could see no more of his boy's rosy cheeks than of his boy's  trim little jacket. His complexion had got pale: his face, at the lower  part, was covered, to my great surprise and disappointment, with a curly  brown beard and mustachios. He had a lively touch-and-go way with him,  very pleasant and engaging, I admit; but nothing to compare with his free-and-easy  manners of other times. To make matters worse, he had promised to be tall,  and had not kept his promise. He was neat, and slim, and well made; but  he wasn't by an inch or two up to the middle height. In short, he baffled  me altogether. The years that had passed had left nothing of his old self,  except the bright, straightforward look in his eyes. There I found our  nice boy again, and there I concluded to stop in my investigation.    `Welcome back to the old place, Mr. Franklin,' I said. `All the more  welcome, sir, that you have come some hours before we expected you.'    `I have a reason for coming before you expected me,' answered Mr. Franklin.  `I suspect, Betteredge, that I have been followed and watched in London,  for the last three or four days; and I have travelled by the morning instead  of the afternoon train, because I wanted to give a certain dark-looking  stranger the slip.'    Those words did more than surprise me. They brought back to my mind,  in a flash, the three jugglers, and Penelope's notion that they meant some  mischief to Mr. Franklin Blake.    `Who's watching you, sir,--and why?' I inquired.    `Tell me about the three Indians you have had at the house today,' says  Mr. Franklin, without noticing my question. `It's just possible, Betteredge,  that my stranger and your three jugglers may turn out to be pieces of the  same puzzle.'    `How do you come to know about the jugglers, sir?' I asked, putting  one question on the top of another, which was bad manners, I own. But you  don't expect much from poor human nature--so don't expect much from me.    `I saw Penelope at the house,' says Mr. Franklin; `and Penelope told  me. Your daughter promised to be a pretty girl, Betteredge, and she has  kept her promise. Penelope has got a small ear and a small foot. Did the  late Mrs. Betteredge possess those inestimable advantages?'    `The late Mrs. Betteredge possessed a good many defects, sir,' says  I. `One of them (if you will pardon my mentioning it) was never keeping  to the matter in hand. She was more like a fly than a woman: she couldn't  settle on anything.'    `She would just have suited me,' says Mr. Franklin. `I never settle  on anything either. Betteredge, your edge is better than ever. Your daughter  said as much, when I asked for particulars about the jugglers. ""Father  will tell you, sir. He's a wonderful man for his age; and he expresses  himself beautifully."" Penelope's own words--blushing divinely. Not even  my respect for you prevented me from--never mind; I knew her when she was  a child, and she's none the worse for it. Let's be serious. What did the  jugglers do?'    I was something dissatisfied with my daughter--not for letting Mr. Franklin  kiss her; Mr. Franklin was welcome to that--but for forcing me to  tell her foolish story at second hand. However, there was no help for it  now but to mention the circumstances. Mr. Franklin's merriment all died  away as I went on. He sat knitting his eyebrows, and twisting his beard.  When I had done, he repeated after me two of the questions which the chief  juggler had put to the boy--seemingly for the purpose of fixing them well  in his mind.    `""Is it on the road to this house, and on no other, that the English  gentleman will travel to-day?"" ""Has the English gentleman got It about  him?"" I suspect,' says Mr. Franklin, pulling a little sealed paper parcel  out of his pocket, `that ""It"" means this. And ""this,"" Betteredge,  means my uncle Herncastle's famous Diamond.'    `Good Lord, sir!' I broke out, `how do you come to be in charge of the  wicked Colonel's Diamond?'    `The wicked Colonel's will has left his Diamond as a birthday present  to my cousin Rachel,' says Mr. Franklin. `And my father, as the wicked  Colonel's executor, has given it in charge to me to bring down here.'    If the sea, then oozing in smoothly over the Shivering Sand, had been  changed into dry land before my own eyes, I doubt if I could have been  more surprised than I was when Mr. Franklin spoke those words.    `The Colonel's Diamond left to Miss Rachel!' says I. `And your father,  sir, the Colonel's executor! Why, I would have laid any bet you like, Mr.  Franklin, that your father wouldn't have touched the Colonel with a pair  of tongs!'    `Strong language, Betteredge! What was there against the Colonel? He  belonged to your time, not to mine. Tell me what you know about him, and  I'll tell you how my father came to be his executor, and more besides.  I have made some discoveries in London about my uncle Herncastle and his  Diamond, which have rather an ugly look to my eyes; and I want you to confirm  them. You called him the ""wicked Colonel"" just now. Search you memory,  my old friend, and tell me why.'    I saw he was in earnest, and I told him.    Here follows the substance of what I said, written out entirely for  your benefit. Pay attention to it, or you will be all abroad, when we get  deeper into the story. Clear your mind of the children, or the dinner,  or the new bonnet, or what not. Try if you can't forget politics, horses,  prices in the City, and grievances at the club. I hope you won't take this  freedom on my part amiss; it's only a way I have of appealing to the gentle  reader. Lord! haven't I seen you with the greatest authors in your hands,  and don't I know how ready your attention is to wander when it's a book  that asks for it, instead of a person?    I spoke, a little way back, of my lady's father, the old lord with the  short temper and the long tongue. He had five children in all. Two sons  to begin with; then, after a long time, his wife broke out breeding again,  and the three young ladies came briskly one after the other, as fast as  the nature of things would permit; my mistress, as before mentioned, being  the youngest and best of the three. Of the two sons, the eldest, Arthur,  inherited the title and estates. The second, the Honourable John, got a  fine fortune left him by a relative, and went into the army.    It's an ill bird, they say, that fouls its own nest. I look on the noble  family of the Herncastles as being my nest; and I shall take it as a favour  if I am not expected to enter into particulars on the subject of the Honourable  John. He was, I honestly believe, one of the greatest blackguards that  ever lived. I can hardly say more or less for him than that. He went into  the army, beginning in the Guards. He had to leave the Guards before he  was two-and-twenty--never mind why. They are very strict in the army, and  they were too strict for the Honourable John. He went out to India to see  whether they were equally strict there, and to try a little active service.  In the matter of bravery (to give him his due), he was a mixture of bull-dog  and game-cock, with a dash of the savage. He was at the taking of Seringapatam.  Soon afterwards he changed into another regiment, and, in course of time,  changed into a third. In the third he got his last step as lieutenant-colonel,  and, getting that, got also a sunstroke, and came home to England.    He came back with a character that closed the doors of all his family  against him, my lady (then just married) taking the lead, and declaring  (with Sir John's approval, of course) that her brother should never enter  any house of hers. There was more than one slur on the Colonel that made  people shy of him; but the blot of the Diamond is all I need mention here.    It was said he had got possession of his Indian jewel by means which,  bold as he was, he didn't dare acknowledge. He never attempted to sell  it--not being in need of money, and not (to give him his due again) making  money an object. He never gave it away; he never even showed it to any  living soul. Some said he was afraid of its getting him into a difficulty  with the military authorities; others (very ignorant indeed of the real  nature of the man) said he was afraid, if he showed it, of its costing  him his life.    There was perhaps a grain of truth mixed up with this last report. It  was false to say that he was afraid; but it was a fact that his life had  been twice threatened in India; and it was firmly believed that the Moonstone  was at the bottom of it. When he came back to England, and found himself  avoided by everybody, the Moonstone was thought to be at the bottom of  it again. The mystery of the Colonel's life got in the Colonel's way, and  outlawed him, as you may say, among his own people. The men wouldn't let  him into their clubs; the women--more than one--whom he wanted to marry,  refused him; friends and relations got too near-sighted to see him in the  street.    Some men in this mess would have tried to set themselves right with  the world. But to give in, even when he was wrong, and had all society  against him, was not the way of the Honourable John. He had kept the Diamond,  in flat defiance of assassination, in India. He kept the Diamond, in flat  defiance of public opinion, in England. There you have the portrait of  the man before you, as in a picture: a character that braved everything;  and a face, handsome as it was, that looked possessed by the devil.    We heard different rumours about him from time to time. Sometimes they  said he was given up to smoking opium and collecting old books; sometimes  he was reported to be trying strange things in chemistry; sometimes he  was seen carousing and amusing himself amongst the lowest people in the  lowest slums of London. Anyhow, a solitary, vicious, underground life was  the life the Colonel led. Once, and once only, after his return to England,  I myself saw him, face to face.    About two years before the time of which I am now writing, and about  a year and a half before the time of his death, the Colonel came unexpectedly  to my lady's house in London. It was the night of Miss Rachel's birthday,  the twenty-first of June; and there was a party in honour of it, as usual.  I received a message from the footman to say that a gentleman wanted to  see me. Going up into the hall, there I found the Colonel, wasted, and  worn, and old, and shabby, and as wild and as wicked as ever.    `Go up to my sister,' says he; `and say that I have called to wish my  niece many happy returns of the day.'    He had made attempts by letter, more than once already, to be reconciled  with my lady, for no other purpose, I am firmly persuaded, than to annoy  her. But this was the first time he had actually come to the house. I had  it on the tip of my tongue to say that my mistress had a party that night.  But the devilish look of him daunted me. I went upstairs with his message,  and left him, by his own desire, waiting in the hall. The servants stood  staring at him, at a distance, as if he was a walking engine of destruction,  loaded with powder and shot, and likely to go off among them at a moment's  notice.    My lady had a dash--no more--of the family temper. `Tell Colonel Herncastle,'  she said, when I gave her her brother's message, `that Miss Verinder is  engaged, and that I decline to see him.' I tried to plead for a  civiller answer than that; knowing the Colonel's constitutional superiority  to the restraints which govern gentlemen in general. Quite useless! The  family temper flashed out at me directly. `When I want your advice,' says  my lady, `you know that I always ask for it. I don't ask for it now.' I  went downstairs with the message, of which I took the liberty of presenting  a new and amended edition of my own contriving, as follows: `My lady and  Miss Rachel regret that they are engaged, Colonel; and beg to be excused  having the honour of seeing you.'    I expected him to break out, even at that polite way of putting it.  To my surprise he did nothing of the sort; he alarmed me by taking the  thing with an unnatural quiet. His eyes, of a glittering bright grey, just  settled on me for a moment; and he laughed, not out of himself,  like other people, but into himself, in a soft, chuckling, horridly  mischievous way. `Thank you, Betteredge,' he said. `I shall remember my  niece's birthday.' With that, he turned on his heel, and walked out of  the house.    The next birthday came round, and we heard he was ill in bed. Six months  afterwards--that is to say, six months before the time I am now writing  of--there came a letter from a highly respectable clergyman to my lady.  It communicated two wonderful things in the way of family news. First,  that the Colonel had forgiven his sister on his death-bed. Second, that  he had forgiven everybody else, and had made a most edifying end. I have  myself (in spite of the bishops and the clergy) an unfeigned respect for  the Church; but I am firmly persuaded, at the same time, that the devil  remained in undisturbed possession of the Honourable John, and that the  last abominable act in the life of that abominable man was (saving your  presence) to take the clergyman in!    This was the sum-total of what I had to tell Mr. Franklin. I remarked  that he listened more and more eagerly the longer I went on. Also, that  the story of the Colonel being sent away from his sister's door, on the  occasion of his niece's birthday, seemed to strike Mr. Franklin like a  shot that had hit the mark. Though he didn't acknowledge it, I saw that  I had made him uneasy, plainly enough, in his face.    `You have said your say, Betteredge,' he remarked. `It's my turn now.  Before, however, I tell you what discoveries I have made in London, and  how I came to be mixed up in this matter of the Diamond, I want to know  one thing. You look, my old friend, as if you didn't quite understand the  object to be answered by this consultation of ours. Do your looks belie  you?'    `No, sir,' I said. `My looks, on this occasion at any rate, tell the  truth.'    `In that case,' says Mr. Franklin, `suppose I put you up to my point  of view, before we go any further. I see three very serious questions involved  in the Colonel's birthday gift to my cousin Rachel. Follow me carefully,  Betteredge; and count me off on your fingers, if it will help you,' says  Mr. Franklin, with a certain pleasure in showing how clear-headed he could  be, which reminded me wonderfully of old times when he was a boy. `Question  the first: Was the Colonel's Diamond the object of a conspiracy in India?  Question the second: Has the conspiracy followed the Colonel's Diamond  to England? Question the third: Did the Colonel know the conspiracy followed  the Diamond; and has he purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to  his sister, through the innocent medium of his sister's child? That  is what I am driving at, Betteredge. Don't let me frighten you.'    It was all very well to say that, but he had frightened me.    If he was right, here was our quiet English house suddenly invaded by  a devilish Indian Diamond--bringing after it a conspiracy of living rogues,  set loose on us by the vengeance of a dead man. There was our situation  as revealed to me in Mr. Franklin's last words! Who ever heard the like  of it--in the nineteenth century, mind; in an age of progress, and in a  country which rejoices in the blessings of the British constitution? Nobody  ever heard the like of it, and, consequently, nobody can be expected to  believe it. I shall go on with my story, however, in spite of that.    When you get a sudden alarm, of the sort that I had got now, nine times  out of ten the place you feel it in is your stomach. When you feel it in  your stomach, your attention wanders, and you begin to fidget. I fidgeted  silently in my place on the sand. Mr. Franklin noticed me, contending with  a perturbed stomach or mind--which you please; they mean the same thing--and,  checking himself just as he was starting with his part of the story, said  to me sharply, `What do you want?'    What did I want? I didn't tell him; but I'll tell you,  in confidence. I wanted a whiff of my pipe, and a turn at Robinson Crusoe.      [Next Chapter] [Table  of Contents]   "
302,Laddie,98,Gene Stratton-porter,Chapter07,"CHAPTER XXVIII.        ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE--PRICE ENTERS IUKA--BATTLE OF IUKA.        At this time, September 4th, I had two divisions of the Army of    the Mississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and    Danville.  There were at Corinth also Davies' division and two    brigades of McArthur's, besides cavalry and artillery.  This    force constituted my left wing, of which Rosecrans was in    command.  General Ord commanded the centre, from Bethel to    Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to    Bolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie    River.  General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with    two of his brigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the    Hatchie River by the Memphis and Ohio railroad.  This made the    most convenient arrangement I could devise for concentrating all    my spare forces upon any threatened point.  All the troops of the    command were within telegraphic communication of each other,    except those under Sherman.  By bringing a portion of his    command to Brownsville, from which point there was a railroad    and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be had with    that part of my command within a few hours by the use of    couriers.  In case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by    this arrangement all the troops at Bolivar, except a small    guard, could be sent by rail by the way of Jackson in less than    twenty-four hours; while the troops from Brownsville could march    up to Bolivar to take their place.        On the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and    Price, apparently upon Corinth.  One division was brought from    Memphis to Bolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from    this move of the enemy.  I was much concerned because my first    duty, after holding the territory acquired within my command,    was to prevent further reinforcing of Bragg in Middle    Tennessee.  Already the Army of Northern Virginia had defeated    the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland.  In the    Centre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg    marching parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the    Ohio River.        I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at    this time my entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all    arms.  This included everything from Cairo south within my    jurisdiction.  If I too should be driven back, the Ohio River    would become the line dividing the belligerents west of the    Alleghanies, while at the East the line was already farther    north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of the    war.  It is true Nashville was never given up after its first    capture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there    would have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in    West Tennessee had been compelled to fall back.  To say at the    end of the second year of the war the line dividing the    contestants at the East was pushed north of Maryland, a State    that had not seceded, and at the West beyond Kentucky, another    State which had been always loyal, would have been discouraging    indeed.  As it was, many loyal people despaired in the fall of    1862 of ever saving the Union.  The administration at Washington    was much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear.    But I believe there was never a day when the President did not    think that, in some way or other, a cause so just as ours would    come out triumphant.        Up to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the    railroad east of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in.  By    the 12th all were in except a small force under Colonel Murphy    of the 8th Wisconsin.  He had been detained to guard the    remainder of the stores which had not yet been brought in to    Corinth.        On the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a    town about twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and    Charleston railroad.  Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding    the place.  He made no resistance, but evacuated the town on the    approach of the enemy.  I was apprehensive lest the object of    the rebels might be to get troops into Tennessee to reinforce    Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained to be.  The authorities    at Washington, including the general-in-chief of the army, were    very anxious, as I have said, about affairs both in East and    Middle Tennessee; and my anxiety was quite as great on their    account as for any danger threatening my command.  I had not    force enough at Corinth to attack Price even by stripping    everything; and there was danger that before troops could be got    from other points he might be far on his way across the    Tennessee.  To prevent this all spare forces at Bolivar and    Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentrated at    Jackson for their transportation.  Within twenty-four hours from    the transmission of the order the troops were at their    destination, although there had been a delay of four hours    resulting from the forward train getting off the track and    stopping all the others.  This gave a reinforcement of near    8,000 men, General Ord in command.  General Rosecrans commanded    the district of Corinth with a movable force of about 9,000    independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be left    behind.  It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four    days' march south of us, with a large force.  It might have been    part of his plan to attack at Corinth, Price coming from the east    while he came up from the south.  My desire was to attack Price    before Van Dorn could reach Corinth or go to his relief.        General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka,    where his command was spread out along the Memphis and    Charleston railroad eastward.  While there he had a most    excellent map prepared showing all the roads and streams in the    surrounding country.  He was also personally familiar with the    ground, so that I deferred very much to him in my plans for the    approach.  We had cars enough to transport all of General Ord's    command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point on the    road about seven miles west of Iuka.  From there his troops were    to march by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from    the north-west, while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his    position south of Corinth by way of the Jacinto road.  A small    force was to hold the Jacinto road where it turns to the    north-east, while the main force moved on the Fulton road which    comes into Iuka further east.  This plan was suggested by    Rosecrans.        Bear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a    formidable obstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of    bridges, all of which, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in    that vicinity.  The Tennessee, to the north-east, not many miles    away, was also a formidable obstacle for an army followed by a    pursuing force.  Ord was on the north-west, and even if a rebel    movement had been possible in that direction it could have    brought only temporary relief, for it would have carried Price's    army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it from all    support.  It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iuka    until we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.        On the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by    rail to Burnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to    perform his part of the programme.  He was to get as near the    enemy as possible during the day and intrench himself so as to    hold his position until the next morning.  Rosecrans was to be    up by the morning of the 19th on the two roads before described,    and the attack was to be from all three quarters    simultaneously.  Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi    to detain any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a    sudden dash into Corinth until I could be notified.  There was a    telegraph wire along the railroad, so there would be no delay in    communication.  I detained cars and locomotives enough at    Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord's command at once, and    if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of Iuka I could    have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or 8,000    before he could have arrived.  I remained at Burnsville with a    detachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated    with my two wings by courier.  Ord met the advance of the enemy    soon after leaving Burnsville.  Quite a sharp engagement ensued,    but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss, including    one general officer killed.  He maintained his position and was    ready to attack by daylight the next morning.  I was very much    disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after    midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka, saying that    some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of his    column was not yet up as far as Jacinto.  He said, however, that    he would still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day.  I did not    believe this possible because of the distance and the condition    of the roads, which was bad; besides, troops after a forced    march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting    the moment they get through.  It might do in marching to relieve    a beleaguered garrison, but not to make an assault.  I    immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and ordered    him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound    of guns to the south or south-east.  He was instructed to notify    his officers to be on the alert for any indications of battle.    During the 19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit    sound either towards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville    where I had remained.        A couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with    the head of his column at garnets, the point where the Jacinto    road to Iuka leaves the road going east.  He here turned north    without sending any troops to the Fulton road.  While still    moving in column up the Jacinto road he met a force of the enemy    and had his advance badly beaten and driven back upon the main    road.  In this short engagement his loss was considerable for    the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him.  The    wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to    transmit sounds towards either Ord or me.  Neither he nor I nor    any one in either command heard a gun that was fired upon the    battle-field.  After the engagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch    announcing the result.  This was brought by a courier.  There was    no road between Burnsville and the position then occupied by    Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a man on    horseback.  The courier bearing the message was compelled to    move west nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to    Burnsville.  This made it a late hour of the night before I    learned of the battle that had taken place during the    afternoon.  I at once notified Ord of the fact and ordered him    to attack early in the morning.  The next morning Rosecrans    himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but little    resistance.  Ord also went in according to orders, without    hearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops    coming from the south-west must be up by that time.  Rosecrans,    however, had put no troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy    had taken advantage of this neglect and retreated by that road    during the night.  Word was soon brought to me that our troops    were in Iuka.  I immediately rode into town and found that the    enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry.  I ordered    pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans' command and went on with him    a few miles in person.  He followed only a few miles after I    left him and then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued    no further.  I was disappointed at the result of the battle of    Iuka--but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans that I    found no fault at the time.    "
304,Lady Chatterley's Lover,50,D. H. Lawrence,Chat16,"CHAPTER VIII            AT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES        What had happened?  Whence the cause of this singular    intoxication, the consequences of which might have been    very disastrous?  A simple blunder of Michel's, which,    fortunately, Nicholl was able to correct in time.        After a perfect swoon, which lasted some minutes, the captain,    recovering first, soon collected his scattered senses.    Although he had breakfasted only two hours before, he felt a    gnawing hunger, as if he had not eaten anything for several days.    Everything about him, stomach and brain, were overexcited to the    highest degree.  He got up and demanded from Michel a    supplementary repast.  Michel, utterly done up, did not answer.        Nicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the    absorption of a dozen sandwiches.  He first tried to get some    fire, and struck a match sharply.  What was his surprise to see    the sulphur shine with so extraordinary a brilliancy as to be    almost unbearable to the eye.  From the gas-burner which he lit    rose a flame equal to a jet of electric light.        A revelation dawned on Nicholl's mind.  That intensity of light,    the physiological troubles which had arisen in him, the    overexcitement of all his moral and quarrelsome faculties-- he    understood all.        ""The oxygen!"" he exclaimed.        And leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that the tap was    allowing the colorless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in    its pure state producing the gravest disorders in the system.    Michel had blunderingly opened the tap of the apparatus to the full.        Nicholl hastened to stop the escape of oxygen with which the    atmosphere was saturated, which would have been the death of the    travelers, not by suffocation, but by combustion.  An hour    later, the air less charged with it restored the lungs to their    normal condition.  By degrees the three friends recovered from    their intoxication; but they were obliged to sleep themselves    sober over their oxygen as a drunkard does over his wine.        When Michel learned his share of the responsibility of this    incident, he was not much disconcerted.  This unexpected    drunkenness broke the monotony of the journey.  Many foolish    things had been said while under its influence, but also    quickly forgotten.        ""And then,"" added the merry Frenchman, ""I am not sorry to have    tasted a little of this heady gas.  Do you know, my friends,    that a curious establishment might be founded with rooms of    oxygen, where people whose system is weakened could for a few    hours live a more active life.  Fancy parties where the room was    saturated with this heroic fluid, theaters where it should be    kept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of the actors    and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm!  And if, instead of    an assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity    in its functions, what a supplement to life it would derive.    From an exhausted nation they might make a great and strong one,    and I know more than one state in old Europe which ought to put    itself under the regime of oxygen for the sake of its health!""        Michel spoke with so much animation that one might have fancied    that the tap was still too open.  But a few words from Barbicane    soon shattered his enthusiasm.        ""That is all very well, friend Michel,"" said he, ""but will you    inform us where these chickens came from which have mixed    themselves up in our concert?""        ""Those chickens?""        ""Yes.""        Indeed, half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking    about, flapping their wings and chattering.        ""Ah, the awkward things!"" exclaimed Michel.  ""The oxygen has    made them revolt.""        ""But what do you want to do with these chickens?"" asked Barbicane.        ""To acclimatize them in the moon, by Jove!""        ""Then why did you hide them?""        ""A joke, my worthy president, a simple joke, which has proved a    miserable failure.  I wanted to set them free on the lunar    continent, without saying anything.  Oh, what would have been    your amazement on seeing these earthly-winged animals pecking in    your lunar fields!""        ""You rascal, you unmitigated rascal,"" replied Barbicane, ""you do    not want oxygen to mount to the head.  You are always what we    were under the influence of the gas; you are always foolish!""        ""Ah, who says that we were not wise then?"" replied Michel Ardan.        After this philosophical reflection, the three friends set about    restoring the order of the projectile.  Chickens and cock were    reinstated in their coop.  But while proceeding with this    operation, Barbicane and his two companions had a most desired    perception of a new phenomenon.  From the moment of leaving the    earth, their own weight, that of the projectile, and the objects    it enclosed, had been subject to an increasing diminution.  If they    could not prove this loss of the projectile, a moment would arrive    when it would be sensibly felt upon themselves and the utensils    and instruments they used.        It is needless to say that a scale would not show this loss; for    the weight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly    as much as the object itself; but a spring steelyard for    example, the tension of which was independent of the attraction,    would have given a just estimate of this loss.        We know that the attraction, otherwise called the weight, is in    proportion to the densities of the bodies, and inversely as the    squares of the distances.  Hence this effect:  If the earth had    been alone in space, if the other celestial bodies had been    suddenly annihilated, the projectile, according to Newton's    laws, would weigh less as it got farther from the earth, but    without ever losing its weight entirely, for the terrestrial    attraction would always have made itself felt, at whatever distance.        But, in reality, a time must come when the projectile would no    longer be subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the    other celestial bodies whose effect could not be set down as zero.    Indeed, the projectile's course was being traced between    the earth and the moon.  As it distanced the earth, the    terrestrial attraction diminished: but the lunar attraction    rose in proportion.  There must come a point where these two    attractions would neutralize each other:  the projectile would    possess weight no longer.  If the moon's and the earth's    densities had been equal, this point would have been at an equal    distance between the two orbs.  But taking the different    densities into consideration, it was easy to reckon that this    point would be situated at 47/60ths of the whole journey,    _i.e._, at 78,514 leagues from the earth.  At this point, a body    having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would    remain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs,    and not being drawn more toward one than toward the other.        Now if the projectile's impulsive force had been correctly    calculated, it would attain this point without speed, having    lost all trace of weight, as well as all the objects within it.    What would happen then?  Three hypotheses presented themselves.        1. Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass    the point of equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue    of the excess of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.        2. Or, its speed failing, and unable to reach the point of equal    attraction, it would fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess    of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.        3. Or, lastly, animated with sufficient speed to enable it to    reach the neutral point, but not sufficient to pass it, it would    remain forever suspended in that spot like the pretended tomb of    Mahomet, between the zenith and the nadir.        Such was their situation; and Barbicane clearly explained the    consequences to his traveling companions, which greatly    interested them.  But how should they know when the projectile    had reached this neutral point situated at that distance,    especially when neither themselves, nor the objects enclosed in    the projectile, would be any longer subject to the laws of weight?        Up to this time, the travelers, while admitting that this action    was constantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its    total absence.        But that day, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Nicholl    having accidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass,    instead of falling, remained suspended in the air.        ""Ah!"" exclaimed Michel Ardan, ""that is rather an amusing piece    of natural philosophy.""        And immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles,    abandoned to themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment.    Diana too, placed in space by Michel, reproduced, but without    any trick, the wonderful suspension practiced by Caston and    Robert Houdin.  Indeed the dog did not seem to know that she was    floating in air.        The three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied,    despite their scientific reasonings.  They felt themselves being    carried into the domain of wonders! they felt that weight was    really wanting to their bodies.  If they stretched out their    arms, they did not attempt to fall.  Their heads shook on    their shoulders.  Their feet no longer clung to the floor of    the projectile.  They were like drunken men having no stability    in themselves.        Fancy has depicted men without reflection, others without shadow.    But here reality, by the neutralizations of attractive forces,    produced men in whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed    nothing themselves.        Suddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained    suspended in the air, like Murillo's monk of the _Cusine des Anges_.        The two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a    miraculous ""Ascension"" in the center of the projectile.        ""Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?""    exclaimed Michel; ""and yet it is so.  Ah! if Raphael had seen us    thus, what an `Assumption' he would have thrown upon canvas!""        ""The `Assumption' cannot last,"" replied Barbicane.  ""If the    projectile passes the neutral point, the lunar attraction will    draw us to the moon.""        ""Then our feet will be upon the roof,"" replied Michel.        ""No,"" said Barbicane, ""because the projectile's center of    gravity is very low; it will only turn by degrees.""        ""Then all our portables will be upset from top to bottom, that    is a fact.""        ""Calm yourself, Michel,"" replied Nicholl; ""no upset is to be    feared; not a thing will move, for the projectile's evolution    will be imperceptible.""        ""Just so,"" continued Barbicane; ""and when it has passed the    point of equal attraction, its base, being the heavier, will    draw it perpendicularly to the moon; but, in order that this    phenomenon should take place, we must have passed the neutral line.""        ""Pass the neutral line,"" cried Michel; ""then let us do as the    sailors do when they cross the equator.""        A slight side movement brought Michel back toward the padded    side; thence he took a bottle and glasses, placed them ""in    space"" before his companions, and, drinking merrily, they    saluted the line with a triple hurrah.  The influence of these    attractions scarcely lasted an hour; the travelers felt    themselves insensibly drawn toward the floor, and Barbicane    fancied that the conical end of the projectile was varying a    little from its normal direction toward the moon.  By an inverse    motion the base was approaching first; the lunar attraction was    prevailing over the terrestrial; the fall toward the moon was    beginning, almost imperceptibly as yet, but by degrees the    attractive force would become stronger, the fall would be more    decided, the projectile, drawn by its base, would turn its cone    to the earth, and fall with ever-increasing speed on to the    surface of the Selenite continent; their destination would then    be attained.  Now nothing could prevent the success of their    enterprise, and Nicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane's joy.        Then they chatted of all the phenomena which had astonished them    one after the other, particularly the neutralization of the laws    of weight.  Michel Ardan, always enthusiastic, drew conclusions    which were purely fanciful.        ""Ah, my worthy friends,"" he exclaimed, ""what progress we should    make if on earth we could throw off some of that weight, some of    that chain which binds us to her; it would be the prisoner set    at liberty; no more fatigue of either arms or legs.  Or, if it    is true that in order to fly on the earth's surface, to keep    oneself suspended in the air merely by the play of the muscles,    there requires a strength a hundred and fifty times greater than    that which we possess, a simple act of volition, a caprice,    would bear us into space, if attraction did not exist.""        ""Just so,"" said Nicholl, smiling; ""if we could succeed in    suppressing weight as they suppress pain by anaesthesia,    that would change the face of modern society!""        ""Yes,"" cried Michel, full of his subject, ""destroy weight, and    no more burdens!""        ""Well said,"" replied Barbicane; ""but if nothing had any weight,    nothing would keep in its place, not even your hat on your head,    worthy Michel; nor your house, whose stones only adhere by    weight; nor a boat, whose stability on the waves is only caused    by weight; not even the ocean, whose waves would no longer be    equalized by terrestrial attraction; and lastly, not even the    atmosphere, whose atoms, being no longer held in their places,    would disperse in space!""        ""That is tiresome,"" retorted Michel; ""nothing like these    matter-of-fact people for bringing one back to the bare reality.""        ""But console yourself, Michel,"" continued Barbicane, ""for if no    orb exists from whence all laws of weight are banished, you are    at least going to visit one where it is much less than on the earth.""        ""The moon?""        ""Yes, the moon, on whose surface objects weigh six times less    than on the earth, a phenomenon easy to prove.""        ""And we shall feel it?"" asked Michel.        ""Evidently, as two hundred pounds will only weigh thirty pounds    on the surface of the moon.""        ""And our muscular strength will not diminish?""        ""Not at all; instead of jumping one yard high, you will rise    eighteen feet high.""        ""But we shall be regular Herculeses in the moon!"" exclaimed Michel.        ""Yes,"" replied Nicholl; ""for if the height of the Selenites is    in proportion to the density of their globe, they will be    scarcely a foot high.""        ""Lilliputians!"" ejaculated Michel; ""I shall play the part    of Gulliver.  We are going to realize the fable of the giants.    This is the advantage of leaving one's own planet and    over-running the solar world.""        ""One moment, Michel,"" answered Barbicane; ""if you wish to play    the part of Gulliver, only visit the inferior planets, such as    Mercury, Venus, or Mars, whose density is a little less than    that of the earth; but do not venture into the great planets,    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; for there the order will be    changed, and you will become Lilliputian.""        ""And in the sun?""        ""In the sun, if its density is thirteen hundred and twenty-four    thousand times greater, and the attraction is twenty-seven times    greater than on the surface of our globe, keeping everything in    proportion, the inhabitants ought to be at least two hundred    feet high.""        ""By Jove!"" exclaimed Michel; ""I should be nothing more than a    pigmy, a shrimp!""        ""Gulliver with the giants,"" said Nicholl.        ""Just so,"" replied Barbicane.        ""And it would not be quite useless to carry some pieces of    artillery to defend oneself.""        ""Good,"" replied Nicholl; ""your projectiles would have no effect    on the sun; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes.""        ""That is a strong remark.""        ""It is certain,"" replied Barbicane; ""the attraction is so great    on this enormous orb, that an object weighing 70,000 pounds on    the earth would weigh but 1,920 pounds on the surface of the sun.    If you were to fall upon it you would weigh-- let me see-- about    5,000 pounds, a weight which you would never be able to raise again.""        ""The devil!"" said Michel; ""one would want a portable crane.    However, we will be satisfied with the moon for the present;    there at least we shall cut a great figure.  We will see about    the sun by and by.""    "
389,My Bondage And My Freedom,91,Frederic Douglass,Chapter04,"CHAPTER 2   Mr Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom  `WHAT I want, you know,' said Mr Tulliver, `what I want, is to give  Tom a good eddication: an eddication as'll be a bread to him. That was  what I was thinking on when I gave notice for him to leave th' Academy  at Ladyday. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.  The two years at th' Academy 'ud ha' done well enough, if I'd meant to  make a miller and farmer of him, for he's had a fine sight more schoolin'  nor I ever got: all the learnin' my father ever paid for  was a bit o' birch at one end and the alphabet at th' other. But I should  like Tom to be a bit of scholard, so as he might be up to the tricks o'these  fellows as talk fine and write wi' a flourish. It 'ud be a help to me wi'  these law-suits and arbitrations and things. I wouldn't make a downright  lawyer o' the lad - I should be sorry for him to be a raskill - but a sort  o' engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or  one o'them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only for  a big watch-chain and a high stool. They're pretty nigh all one, and they're  not far off being even wi' the law, I believe; for Riley looks Lawyer  Wakem i' the face as hard as one cat looks another. He's none frighted  at him.' Mr Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in  a fan-shaped cap. (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped  caps were worn - they must be so near coming in again. At that time, when  Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St Ogg's and considered  sweet things.)    `Well, Mr Tulliver, you know best: I've no objections. But hadn't  I better kill a couple o' fowl and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner  next week, so as you may hear what Sister Glegg and Sister Pullet have  got to say about it? There's a couple o' fowl wants killing!'    `You may kill every fowl i' the yard, if you like, Bessy; but I shall  ask neither aunt nor uncle what I'm to do wi'my own lad,' said Mr Tulliver,  defiantly.    `Dear heart,' said Mrs Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric,  `how can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? But it's your way to speak disrespectful  o' my family, and Sister Glegg throws all the blame upo' me, though I'm  sure I'm as innocent as the babe unborn. For nobody's ever heard me  say as it wasn't lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can  live independent. Howiver, if Tom's to go to a new school, I should like  him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else he might as well have  calico as linen, for they'd be one as yallow as th' other before they'd  been washed half-a-dozen times. And then, when the box is goin'backards  and forrards, I could send the lad a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple;  for he can do with an extry bit, bless him, whether they stint him at the  meals or no. My children can eat as much victuals as most, thank God.'    `Well, well, we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart, if  other things fit in,' said Mr Tulliver. `But you mustn't put a spoke i'  the wheel about the washin', if we can't get a school near enough. That's  the fault I have to find wi' you, Bessy: if you see a stick i' the road,  you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it. You'd want me not to hire  a good waggoner, 'cause he'd got a mole on his face.'    `Dear heart!' said Mrs Tulliver, in mild surprise, `when did I iver  make objections to a man, because he'd got a mole on his face? I'm sure  I'm rether fond o' the moles, for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had  a mole on his brow. But I can't remember your iver offering to hire a waggoner  with a mole, Mr Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole on his face  no more nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire him; an'  so you did hire him, an' if he hadn't died o' th' inflammation, as we paid  Dr Turnbull for attending him, he'd very like ha' been driving the waggon  now. He might have a mole somewhere out o' sight, but how was I to know  that, Mr Tulliver?'    `No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for  summat else; but niver mind - it's puzzling work, talking is. What I'm  thinking on, is how to find the right sort o' school to send Tom to, for  I might be ta'en in again, as I've been wi' the 'Cademy. I'll have nothing  to do wi' a 'Cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it shan't be  a 'Cademy. It shall be a place where the lads spend their time i' summat  else besides blacking the family's shoes, and getting up the potatoes.  It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick.'    Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his  breeches' pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there. Apparently  he was not disappointed, for he presently said, `I know what I'll do -  I'll talk it over wi'Riley: he's coming to-morrow, t' arbitrate about the  dam.'    `Well, Mr Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and Kezia's  got 'em hanging at the fire. They aren't the best sheets, but they're good  enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as for them best  Holland sheets, I should repent buying 'em, only they'll do to lay us out  in. An' if you was to die to-morrow, Mr Tulliver, they're mangled beautiful,  an' all ready, an' smell o' lavender as it 'ud be a pleasure to lay 'em  out. An' they lie at the left-hand corner o' the big oak linen-chest, at  the back: not as I should trust anybody to look 'em out but myself.'    As Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence she drew a bright bunch of  keys from her pocket, and single out one, rubbing her thumb and finger  up and down it with a placid smile, while she looked at the clear fire.  If Mr Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relations, he  might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in  anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production  of the best Holland sheets. Happily he was not so: he was only susceptible  in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he had the marital habit  of not listening very closely, and, since his mention of Mr Riley, had  been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings.    `I think I've hit it, Bessy,' was his first remark after a short silence.  `Riley's as likely a man as any to know o'some school: he's had schooling  himself, an' goes about to all sorts o' places, arbitratin' and vallyin'  and that. And we shall have time to talk it over to-morrow night when the  business is done. I want Tom to be such a sort o' man as Riley, you know  - as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him, and  knows a good lot o' words as don't mean much, so as you can't lay hold  of'em i' law; and a good solid knowledge o' business too.'    `Well,' said Mrs Tulliver, `so far as talking proper and knowing everything,  and walking with a bend in his back and setting his hair up, I shouldn't  mind the lad being brought up to that. But them fine-talking men from the  big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they wear a frill till it's  all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know Riley does. And then, if  Tom's to go and live at Mudport, like Riley, he'll have a house with a  kitchen hardly big enough to turn in, an' niver get a fresh egg for his  breakfast, an'sleep up three pair o' stairs - or four, for what I know  - an'be burnt to death before he gets down.'    `No, no,' said Mr Tulliver, `I've no thoughts of his going to Mudport:  I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg's close by us, an' live at home.  But,' continued Mr Tulliver after a pause, `what I'm a bit afraid on is,  as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brians for a smart fellow. I doubt  he's a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy.'    `Yes, that he does,' said Mrs Tulliver, accepting the last proposition  entirely on its own merits, `he's wonderful for liking a deal o' salt in  his broth. That was my brother's way and my father's before him.'    `It seems a bit of a pity, though,' said Mr Tulliver, `as the lad should  take after the mother's side istead o' the little wench. That's the worst  on't wi' the crossing o' breeds: you can never justly calkilate what'll  come on't. The little un takes after my side, now: she's twice as 'cute  as Tom. Too 'cute for a woman, I'm afraid,' continued Mr Tulliver, turning  his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other. `It's no mischief  much while she's a little un, but an over 'cute woman's no better nor a  long-tailed sheep - she'll fetch none the bigger price for that.'    `Yes, it is a mischief while she's a little un, Mr Tulliver,  for it all runs to naughtiness. How to keep her in a clean pinafore two  hours together passes my cunning. An' now you put me i' mind,' continued  Mrs Tulliver, rising and going to the window, `I don't know where she is  now, an'it's pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so - wanderin' up an'  down by the water, like a wild thing: she'll tumble in same day.'    Mrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,  - a process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her  chair.    `You talk o' 'cuteness, Mr Tulliver,' she observed as she sat down,  `but I'm sure the child's half a idiot i' some things, for if I send her  up-stairs to fetch anything she forgets what she's gone for, an' perhaps  'ull sit down on the floor i' the sunshine an' plait her hair an' sing  to herself like a Bedlam creatur', all the while I'm waiting for her down-stairs.  That niver run i' my family, thank God, no more nor a brown skin as makes  her look like a mulatter. I don't like to fly i' the face o' Providence,  but it seems hard as I should have but one gell, an' her so comical.'    `Pooh, nonsense!' said Mr Tulliver, `she's a straight black-eyed wench  as anybody need wish to see. I don't know i' what she's behind other folk's  children; an' she can read almost as well as the parson.'    `But her hair won't curl all I can do with it and she's so franzy about  having it put i' paper, an' I've such work as never was to make her stand  and have it pinched with th'irons.'    `Cut it off - cut if off short,' said the father, rashly.    `How can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? She's too big a gell, gone nine,  and tall of her age - to have her hair cut short; an' there's her cousin  Lucy's got a row o' curls round her head, an' not a hair out o' place.  It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I'm sure  Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie, Maggie,' continued  the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this small mistake  of nature entered the room, `where's the use o' my telling you to keep  away from the water? You'll tumble in and be drownded some day, an' then  you'll be sorry you didn't do as mother told you.'    Maggie's hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her  mother's accusation: Mrs Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a curled  crop, `like other folk's children,' had had it cut too short in front to  be pushed behind the ears, and as it was usually straight an hour after  it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly tossing her head  to keep the dark heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes - an action  which gave her very much the air of a small Shetland pony.    `O dear, O dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin' of, to throw your bonnet  down there? Take it upstairs, there's a good gell, an' let your hair be  brushed, an' put your other pinafore on, an' change your shoes - do, for  shame; an'come an' go on with your patchwork, like a little lady.'    `O mother,' said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, `I don't want  to do my patchwork.'    `What, not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt  Glegg?'    `It's foolish work,' said Maggie, with a toss of her mane, - `tearing  things to pieces to sew 'em together again. And I don't want to do anything  for my aunt Glegg - I don't like her.'    Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr Tulliver laughs  audibly.    `I wonder at you, as you'll laugh at her, Mr Tulliver,' said the mother,  with lymphatic fretfulness in her tone. `You encourage her i' naughtiness.  An' her aunts will have it as it's me spoils her.'    Mrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person - never cried  when she was a baby on any slighter ground than hunger and pins, and from  the cradle upwards had been healthy, fair plump, and dull-witted, in short,  the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk and mildness  are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn only a little sour  they may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I have often wondered  whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the blond faces and somewhat  stupid expression, kept their placidity undisturbed when their strong-limbed  strong-willed boys got a little too old to do without clothing. I think  they must have been given to feeble remonstrance, getting more and more  peevish as it became more and more ineffectual.        "
393,Nana,74,Emile Zola,Chapter09,"TOLSTOY: Anna Karenina Part 5, Chapter 24   [Previous Chapter] [Table  of Contents]      Chapter 24  The levee was drawing to a close. People met as they were going away, and  gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors, and the changes  in the positions of the higher functionaries.     `If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess  Vatkovsky were Commander in Chief,' said a gray-headed, little old man  in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of honor  who had questioned him about the new appointments.     `And if I were one of the adjutants,' said the maid of honor,  smiling.     `You have an appointment already. You're over the Ecclesiastical  Department. And your assistant's Karenin.'     `Good day, Prince!' said the little old man to a man who came  up to him.     `What were you saying of Karenin?' said the Prince.     `He and Putiatov have received the order of Alexandre Nevsky.'     `I thought he had it already.'     `No. Just look at him,' said the little old man, pointing with  his embroidered hat to Karenin in a Court uniform, with the new red ribbon  across his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential  member of the Imperial Council. `Pleased and happy as brass,' he added,  stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of  colossal proportions.     `No - he's looking older,' said the gentleman of the bedchamber.     `From overwork. He's always drawing up projects nowadays. He won't  let a poor devil go nowadays till he's explained it all to him under heads.'     `Looking older, did you say? Il fait des passions. I believe  Countess Lidia Ivanovna's jealous now of his wife.'     `Oh, come now, please don't say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.'     `Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?'     `But is it true Madame Karenina's here?'     `Well, not here in the palace, but in Peterburg. I met her yesterday  with Alexei Vronsky, bras dessus, bras dessous, on the Morskaia.'     `C'est un homme qui n'a pas...' the gentleman of the bedchamber  was beginning, but he stopped to make room, bowing, for a member of the  Imperial family to pass.     Thus people talked incessantly of Alexei Alexandrovich, finding  fault with him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the way of the  member of the Imperial Council he had captured, was explaining to him point  by point his new financial project, never interrupting his discourse for  an instant for fear he should escape.     Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexei Alexandrovich  there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official  - the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop. This full stop  had arrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexei Alexandrovich himself  was not yet aware that his career was over. Whether it was due to his feud  with Stremov, or his misfortune with his wife, or simply that Alexei Alexandrovich  had reached his predestined limits, it had become evident to everyone in  the course of that year that his career was at an end. He still filled  a position of consequence, he sat on many commissions and committees, but  he was a man whose day was over, and from whom nothing was expected. Whatever  he said, whatever he proposed, was heard as though it were something long  familiar, and the very thing that was not needed. But Alexei Alexandrovich  was not aware of this, and, on the contrary, being cut off from direct  participation in governmental activity, he saw more clearly than ever the  errors and defects in the action of others, and thought it his duty to  point out means for their correction. Shortly after his separation from  his wife, he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure,  the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the  future.     Alexei Alexandrovich did not merely fail to observe his hopeless  position in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety on  this head - he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity.     `He that is married careth for the things of the world, how he  may please his wife; he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong  to the Lord, how he may please the Lord,' says the Apostle Paul, and Alexei  Alexandrovich, who was now guided in every action by Scripture, often recalled  this text. It seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a  wife, he had, in these very projects of reform, been serving the Lord more  zealously than ever.     The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying  to get away from him did not trouble Alexei Alexandrovich; he gave up his  exposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his chance when  one of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him.     Left alone, Alexei Alexandrovich looked down, collecting his thoughts,  then looked casually about him and walked toward the door, where he hoped  to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.     `And how strong they all are - how sound physically,' thought  Alexei Alexandrovich, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the  bedchamber with his well-groomed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck  of the Prince, pinched by his tight uniform. He had to pass them on his  way. `Truly is it said that all the world is evil,' he thought, with another  sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber.     Moving forward deliberately, Alexei Alexandrovich bowed with his  customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking  about him, and, looking toward the door, his eyes sought Countess Lidia  Ivanovna.     `Ah! Alexei Alexandrovich!' said the little old man, with a malicious  light in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin had come up to them, and  was nodding with a frigid gesture. `I haven't congratulated you yet,' said  the old man, pointing to his newly received ribbon.     `Thank you,' answered Alexei Alexandrovich. `What an exquisite  day today,' he added, laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word exquisite.     That they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect  anything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.     Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting  out above her corset, and her fine pensive eyes summoning him to her, Alexei  Alexandrovich smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went toward  her.     Lidia Ivanovna's dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all  her dresses had done of late. Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse  of what she had pursued thirty years before. Then her desire had been to  adorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better. Now, on  the contrary, she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with  her age and her figure, that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast  between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling.  And as far as Alexei Alexandrovich was concerned she succeeded, and was  in his eyes attractive. For him she was the one island not only of good  will to him, but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering  that surrounded him.     Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally  to her loving glance as a plant to the sun.     `I congratulate you,' she said to him, her eyes on his ribbon.     Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, closing  his eyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him.  Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief  sources of satisfaction, though he never admitted it.     `How is our angel?' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seriozha.     `I can't say I was quite pleased with him,' said Alexei Alexandrovich,  raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes. `And Sitnikov is not satisfied  with him.' (Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seriozha's secular education  had been intrusted.) `As I have mentioned to you, there's a sort of coldness  in him toward the most important questions which ought to touch the heart  of every man and every child....' Alexei Alexandrovich began expounding  his views on the sole question that interested him outside the service  - the education of his son.     When Alexei Alexandrovich, with Lidia Ivanovna's help, had been  brought back anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to undertake  the education of the son left on his hands. Having never before taken any  interest in educational questions, Alexei Alexandrovich devoted some time  to the theoretical study of the subject. After reading several books on  anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexei Alexandrovich drew up a  plan of education, and, engaging the best tutor in Peterburg to superintend  it, he set to work, and the subject continually absorbed him.     `Yes - but the heart! I see in him his father's heart, and with  such a heart a child cannot go far wrong,' said Lidia Ivanovna with enthusiasm.     `Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty. It's all I can do.'     `You're coming to me,' said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause;  `we have to speak of a subject painful for you. I would give anything to  have spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.  I have received a letter from her. She is here in Peterburg.'     Alexei Alexandrovich shuddered at the allusion to his wife, but  immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter  helplessness in the matter.     `I was expecting it,' he said.     Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears  of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes.          [Next Chapter] [Table  of Contents]      "
394,Natural Value,95,Friedrich Wieser,Book06,"III            He had taken the train a few days after this from a station--    as well as to a station--selected almost at random; such days,    whatever should happen, were numbered, and he had gone forth under    the impulse--artless enough, no doubt--to give the whole of one of    them to that French ruralism, with its cool special green, into    which he had hitherto looked only through the little oblong window    of the picture-frame.  It had been as yet for the most part but a    land of fancy for him--the background of fiction, the medium of    art, the nursery of letters; practically as distant as Greece, but    practically also well-nigh as consecrated.  Romance could weave    itself, for Strether's sense, out of elements mild enough; and even    after what he had, as he felt, lately ""been through,"" he could    thrill a little at the chance of seeing something somewhere that    would remind him of a certain small Lambinet that had charmed him,    long years before, at a Boston dealer's and that he had quite    absurdly never forgotten.  It had been offered, he remembered, at a    price he had been instructed to believe the lowest ever named for a    Lambinet, a price he had never felt so poor as on having to recognise,    all the same, as beyond a dream of possibility.  He had dreamed--    had turned and twisted possibilities for an hour:  it had been    the only adventure of his life in connexion with the purchase    of a work of art.  The adventure, it will be perceived, was modest;    but the memory, beyond all reason and by some accident of    association, was sweet.  The little Lambinet abode with him as the    picture he WOULD have bought--the particular production that had    made him for the moment overstep the modesty of nature.  He was    quite aware that if he were to see it again he should perhaps have    a drop or a shock, and he never found himself wishing that the    wheel of time would turn it up again, just as he had seen it in the    maroon-coloured, sky-lighted inner shrine of Tremont Street.    It would be a different thing, however, to see the remembered mixture    resolved back into its elements--to assist at the restoration to    nature of the whole far-away hour:  the dusty day in Boston, the    background of the Fitchburg Depot, of the maroon-coloured sanctum,    the special-green vision, the ridiculous price, the poplars, the    willows, the rushes, the river, the sunny silvery sky, the shady    woody horizon.        He observed in respect to his train almost no condition save that    it should stop a few times after getting out of the banlieue;    he threw himself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of    where to alight.  His theory of his excursion was that he could    alight anywhere--not nearer Paris than an hour's run--on catching a    suggestion of the particular note required.  It made its sign, the    suggestion--weather, air, light, colour and his mood all favouring--    at the end of some eighty minutes; the train pulled up just at the    right spot, and he found himself getting out as securely as if to    keep an appointment.  It will be felt of him that he could amuse    himself, at his age, with very small things if it be again noted    that his appointment was only with a superseded Boston fashion.  He    hadn't gone far without the quick confidence that it would be    quite sufficiently kept.  The oblong gilt frame disposed its    enclosing lines; the poplars and willows, the reeds and river--    a river of which he didn't know, and didn't want to know, the name--    fell into a composition, full of felicity, within them; the sky    was silver and turquoise and varnish; the village on the left was    white and the church on the right was grey; it was all there, in    short--it was what he wanted:  it was Tremont Street, it was France,    it was Lambinet.  Moreover he was freely walking about in it.    He did this last, for an hour, to his heart's content, making    for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his impression    and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them again    and reached the maroon-coloured wall.  It was a wonder, no doubt,    that the taste of idleness for him shouldn't need more time to    sweeten; but it had in fact taken the few previous days; it had    been sweetening in truth ever since the retreat of the Pococks.    He walked and walked as if to show himself how little he had now to do;    he had nothing to do but turn off to some hillside where he might    stretch himself and hear the poplars rustle, and whence--in the    course of an afternoon so spent, an afternoon richly suffused too    with the sense of a book in his pocket--he should sufficiently    command the scene to be able to pick out just the right little    rustic inn for an experiment in respect to dinner.  There was a    train back to Paris at 9.20, and he saw himself partaking, at the    close of the day, with the enhancements of a coarse white cloth and    a sanded door, of something fried and felicitous, washed down with    authentic wine; after which he might, as he liked, either stroll    back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the local    carriole and converse with his driver, a driver who naturally wouldn't    fail of a stiff clean blouse, of a knitted nightcap and of the genius    of response--who, in fine, would sit on the shafts, tell him what    the French people were thinking, and remind him, as indeed the whole    episode would incidentally do, of Maupassant.  Strether heard his lips,    for the first time in French air, as this vision assumed consistency,    emit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company.    He had been afraid of Chad and of Maria and of Madame de Vionnet;    he had been most of all afraid of Waymarsh, in whose presence,    so far as they had mixed together in the light of the town, he had    never without somehow paying for it aired either his vocabulary    or his accent.  He usually paid for it by meeting immediately    afterwards Waymarsh's eye.        Such were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had    turned off to the hillside that did really and truly, as well as    most amiably, await him beneath the poplars, the hillside that made    him feel, for a murmurous couple of hours, how happy had been his    thought.  He had the sense of success, of a finer harmony in    things; nothing but what had turned out as yet according to his plan.    It most of all came home to him, as he lay on his back on the grass,    that Sarah had really gone, that his tension was really relaxed;    the peace diffused in these ideas might be delusive, but it hung about    him none the less for the time.  It fairly, for half an hour,    sent him to sleep; he pulled his straw hat over his eyes--    he had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of Waymarsh's--    and lost himself anew in Lambinet.  It was as if he had found out    he was tired--tired not from his walk, but from that inward    exercise which had known, on the whole, for three months, so little    intermission.  That was it--when once they were off he had dropped;    this moreover was what he had dropped to, and now he was touching    bottom.  He was kept luxuriously quiet, soothed and amused by the    consciousness of what he had found at the end of his descent.  It    was very much what he had told Maria Gostrey he should like to stay    on for, the hugely-distributed Paris of summer, alternately    dazzling and dusky, with a weight lifted for him off its columns    and cornices and with shade and air in the flutter of awnings as    wide as avenues.  It was present to him without attenuation that,    reaching out, the day after making the remark, for some proof of    his freedom, he had gone that very afternoon to see Madame de Vionnet.    He had gone again the next day but one, and the effect of the two    visits, the after-sense of the couple of hours spent with her,    was almost that of fulness and frequency.  The brave intention of    frequency, so great with him from the moment of his finding himself    unjustly suspected at Woollett, had remained rather theoretic,    and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars was    the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful.    He had surely got rid of it now, this special shyness; what had become    of it if it hadn't precisely, within the week, rubbed off?        It struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had    still been careful he had been so for a reason.  He had really    feared, in his behaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a    danger of one's liking such a woman too much one's best safety was    in waiting at least till one had the right to do so.  In the light    of the last few days the danger was fairly vivid; so that it was    proportionately fortunate that the right was likewise established.    It seemed to our friend that he had on each occasion profited to    the utmost by the latter:  how could he have done so more, he at    all events asked himself, than in having immediately let her know    that, if it was all the same to her, he preferred not to talk about    anything tiresome?  He had never in his life so sacrificed an    armful of high interests as in that remark; he had never so prepared    the way for the comparatively frivolous as in addressing it to    Madame de Vionnet's intelligence.  It hadn't been till later that    he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the pleasant    he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked about;    it was not till later even that he remembered how, with their new tone,    they hadn't so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself.    One of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was    this delightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone;    he thought, as he lay on his back, of all the tones she might make    possible if one were to try her, and at any rate of the probability    that one could trust her to fit them to occasions.  He had wanted her    to feel that, as he was disinterested now, so she herself should be,    and she had showed she felt it, and he had showed he was grateful,    and it had been for all the world as if he were calling for    the first time.  They had had other, but irrelevant, meetings;    it was quite as if, had they sooner known how much they REALLY    had in common, there were quantities of comparatively dull matters    they might have skipped.  Well, they were skipping them now,    even to graceful gratitude, even to handsome ""Don't mention it!""--    and it was amazing what could still come up without reference to    what had been going on between them.  It might have been, on analysis,    nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical glasses; but it had    served all the purpose of his appearing to have said to her:    ""Don't like me, if it's a question of liking me, for anything obvious    and clumsy that I've, as they call it, 'done' for you:  like me--    well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose.  So, by    the same propriety, don't be for me simply the person I've come to know    through my awkward connexion with Chad--was ever anything, by the way,    MORE awkward?  Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and trust,    just whatever I may show you it's a present pleasure to me to think you.""    It had been a large indication to meet; but if she hadn't met it    what HAD she done, and how had their time together slipped along    so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his    happy illusion of idleness?  He could recognise on the other hand    that he had probably not been without reason, in his prior, his    restricted state, for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse    from good faith.        He really continued in the picture--that being for himself his    situation--all the rest of this rambling day; so that the charm was    still, was indeed more than ever upon him when, toward six o'clock    he found himself amicably engaged with a stout white-capped    deep-voiced woman at the door of the auberge of the biggest village,    a village that affected him as a thing of whiteness, blueness and    crookedness, set in coppery green, and that had the river flowing    behind or before it--one couldn't say which; at the bottom, in    particular, of the inn-garden.  He had had other adventures before this;    had kept along the height, after shaking off slumber; had admired,    had almost coveted, another small old church, all steep roof and    dim slate-colour without and all whitewash and paper flowers within;    had lost his way and had found it again; had conversed with rustics    who struck him perhaps a little more as men of the world than he had    expected; had acquired at a bound a fearless facility in French;    had had, as the afternoon waned, a watery bock, all pale and Parisian,    in the cafe of the furthest village, which was not the biggest;    and had meanwhile not once overstepped the oblong gilt frame.    The frame had drawn itself out for him, as much as you please;    but that was just his luck.  He had finally come down again to the    valley, to keep within touch of stations and trains, turning his face    to the quarter from which he had started; and thus it was that he had    at last pulled up before the hostess of the Cheval Blanc, who met him,    with a rough readiness that was like the clatter of sabots over stones,    on their common ground of a cotelette de veau a l'oseille and a    subsequent lift.  He had walked many miles and didn't know he was tired;    but he still knew he was amused, and even that, though he had been    alone all day, he had never yet so struck himself as engaged with    others and in midstream of his drama.  It might have passed for    finished his drama, with its catastrophe all but reached:  it had,    however, none the less been vivid again for him as he thus gave it    its fuller chance.  He had only had to be at last well out of it to    feel it, oddly enough, still going on.        For this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picture--that    it was essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage,    that the very air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and    the tone of the sky.  The play and the characters had, without his    knowing it till now, peopled all his space for him, and it seemed    somehow quite happy that they should offer themselves, in the    conditions so supplied, with a kind of inevitability.  It was as if    the conditions made them not only inevitable, but so much more    nearly natural and right as that they were at least easier,    pleasanter, to put up with.  The conditions had nowhere so asserted    their difference from those of Woollett as they appeared to him to    assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc while he arranged    with his hostess for a comfortable climax.  They were few and    simple, scant and humble, but they were THE THING, as he would have    called it, even to a greater degree than Madame de Vionnet's old    high salon where the ghost of the Empire walked.  ""The"" thing was    the thing that implied the greatest number of other things of the    sort he had had to tackle; and it was queer of course, but so it    was--the implication here was complete.  Not a single one of his    observations but somehow fell into a place in it; not a breath of    the cooler evening that wasn't somehow a syllable of the text.    The text was simply, when condensed, that in THESE places such    things were, and that if it was in them one elected to move about    one had to make one's account with what one lighted on.  Meanwhile    at all events it was enough that they did affect one--so far as the    village aspect was concerned--as whiteness, crookedness and    blueness set in coppery green; there being positively, for that    matter, an outer wall of the White Horse that was painted the most    improbable shade.  That was part of the amusement--as if to show    that the fun was harmless; just as it was enough, further, that the    picture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good    woman's broad sketch of what she could do for her visitor's    appetite.  He felt in short a confidence, and it was general, and    it was all he wanted to feel.  It suffered no shock even on her    mentioning that she had in fact just laid the cloth for two persons    who, unlike Monsieur, had arrived by the river--in a boat of their    own; who had asked her, half an hour before, what she could do for    them, and had then paddled away to look at something a little    further up--from which promenade they would presently return.    Monsieur might meanwhile, if he liked, pass into the garden, such    as it was, where she would serve him, should he wish it--for there    were tables and benches in plenty--a ""bitter"" before his repast.    Here she would also report to him on the possibility of a    conveyance to his station, and here at any rate he would have the    agrement of the river .        It may be mentioned without delay that Monsieur had the agrement of    everything, and in particular, for the next twenty minutes,    of a small and primitive pavilion that, at the garden's edge, almost    overhung the water, testifying, in its somewhat battered state, to    much fond frequentation.  It consisted of little more than a    platform, slightly raised, with a couple of benches and a table, a    protecting rail and a projecting roof; but it raked the full    grey-blue stream, which, taking a turn a short distance above,    passed out of sight to reappear much higher up; and it was clearly    in esteemed requisition for Sundays and other feasts.  Strether sat    there and, though hungry, felt at peace; the confidence that had so    gathered for him deepened with the lap of the water, the ripple of    the surface, the rustle of the reeds on the opposite bank, the    faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a couple of small    boats attached to a rough landing-place hard by.  The valley on the    further side was all copper-green level and glazed pearly sky, a    sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees, which looked    flat, like espaliers; and though the rest of the village straggled    away in the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of    the boats suggestive.  Such a river set one afloat almost before    one could take up the oars--the idle play of which would be    moreover the aid to the full impression.  This perception went so    far as to bring him to his feet; but that movement, in turn, made    him feel afresh that he was tired, and while he leaned against a    post and continued to look out he saw something that gave him a    sharper arrest.      "
578,Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758),33,Benjamin Franklin,Poor Richard- 1737,"Chapter 10    Questions and Answers    ""Well,"" said the old man, shifting in his chair, ""you must get on with  your questions, Guest; I have been some time answering this first  one.""    Said I: ""I want an extra word or two about your ideas of education;  although I gathered from Dick that you let your children run wild and  didn't teach them anything; and in short, that you have so refined  your education, that now you have none.""    ""Then you gathered left-handed,"" quoth he."" But of course I understand  your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when  `the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (_i.e.,_the struggle  for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the  slave-holders' privilege on the other), pinched `education' for most  people into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information;  something to be swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether  he liked it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been  chewed and digested over and over again by people who didn't care  about it in order to serve it out to other people who didn't care  about it.""    I stopped the old man's rising wrath by a laugh, and said: ""Well,  _you_ were not taught that way, at any rate, so you may let your anger  run off you a little.""    ""True, true,"" said he smiling. ""I thank you for correcting my ill  temper: I always fancy myself as living in any period of which we may  be speaking. But, however, to put it in a cooler way: you expected to  see children thrust into schools when they had reached an age  conventionally supposed to be the due age, whatever their varying  faculties and dispositions might be, and when there, with like  disregard to facts, to be subjected to a certain conventional courese  of `learning'. My friend, can't you see that such a proceeding means  ignoring the fact of _growth_, bodily and mental? No one could come  out of such a mill uninjured; and those only would avoid being crushed  by it who would have the spirit of rebellion strong in them.  Fortunately most children have had that at all times, or I do not know  that we should ever have reached our present position. Now you see  what it all comes to. In the old times all this was the result of  _poverty_. In the nineteenth century, society was so miserably poor,  owing to the systematised robbery on which it was founded that real  education was impossible for anybody. The whole theory of their so  called education was that it was necessary to shove a little  information into a child, even if it were by means of torture, and  accompanied by twaddle which it was well known was of no use, or else  he would lack information lifelong: the hurry of poverty forbade  anything else. All that is past; we are no longer hurried, and the  information lies ready to each one's hand when his own inclinations  impel him to seek it. In this as in other matters we have become  wealthy: we can afford to give ourselves time to grow.""    ""Yes,"" said I, ""but suppose the child, youth, man, never wants the  information, never grows in the direction you might hope him to do:  suppose, for instance, he objects to learning arithmetic or  mathematics; you can't force him when he _is_ grown; can't you force  him while he is growing, and oughtn't you to do so?""    ""Well,"" said he, ""were you forced to learn arithmetic and  mathematics?""    ""A little,"" said I.    ""And how old are you now?""    ""Say fifty-six,"" said I.    ""And how much arithmetic and mathematics do you know now?"" quoth the  old man, smiling rather mockingly.    Said I: ""None whatever, I am sorry to say.""    Hammond laughed quietly, but made no other comment on my admission,  and I dropped the subject of education, perceiving him to be hopeless  on that side.    I thought a little, and said: ""You were speaking just now of  households: that sounded to me a little like the customs of past  times; I should have thought you would have lived more in public.""    ""Phalangsteries, eh?"" said he. ""Well, we live as we like, and we like  to live as a rule with certain house-mates that we have got used to.  Remember, again, that poverty is extinct, and that the Fourierist  phalangsteries and all their kind, as was but natural at the time,  implied nothing but a refuge from mere destitution. Such a way of life  as that, could only have been conceived of by people surrounded by the  worst form of poverty. But you must understand therewith, that though  separate households are the rule amongst us, and though they differ in  their habits more or less, yet no door is shut to any good-tempered  person who is content to live as the other house-mates do: only of  course it would be unreasonable for one man to drop into a house-hold  and bid the folk of it to alter their habits to please him, since he  can go elsewhere and live as he pleases. However, I need not say much  about all this as you are going up the river with Dick, and will find  out for yourself by experience how these matters are managed.""    After a pause, I said: ""Your big towns, now; how about them? London,  which--which I have read about as the modern Babylon of civilisation,  seems to have disappeared.""    ""Well, well,"" said old Hammond, ""perhaps after all it is more like  ancient Babylon now than the `modern Babylon' of the nineteenth  century was. But let that pass. After all, there is a good deal of  population in places between here and Hammersmith; nor have you seen  the most populous part of the town yet.""    ""Tell me, then,"" said I, ""how is it towards the east?""    Said he: ""Time was when if you mounted a good horse and rode straight  away from my door here at a round trot for an hour and a half, you  would still be in the thick of London, and the greater part of that  would be `slums', as they were called; that is to say, places of  torture for innocent men and women; or worse, stews for rearing and  breeding men and women in such degradation that that torture should  seem to them mere ordinary and natural life.""    ""I know, I know,"" I said, rather impatiently, ""That was what was; tell  me something of what is. Is there any of that left?""    ""Not an inch,"" said he; ""but some memory of it abides with us, and I  am glad of it. Once a year, on May-day, we hold a solemn feast in  those easterly communes of London to commemorate The Clearing of  Misery, as it is called. On that day we have music and dancing, and  merry games and happy feasting on the site of some of the worst of the  old slums, the traditional memory of which we have kept. On that  occasion the custom is for the prettiest girls to sing some of the old  revolutionary songs, and those which were the groans of the  discontent, once so hopeless, on the very spots where those terrible  crimes of class-murder were committed day by day for so many years. To  a man like me, who have studied the past so diligently, it is a  curious and touching sight to see some beautiful girl, daintily clad,  and crowned with flowers from the neighbouring meadows standing  amongst the happy people, on some mound where of old time stood the  wretched apology for a house, a den in which men and women lived  packed amongst the filth like pilchards in a cask; lived in such a way  that they could only have endured it, as I said just now, by being  degraded out of humanity--to hear the terrible words of threatening  and lamentation coming from her sweet and beautiful lips, and she  unconscious of their real meaning: to hear her, for instance, singing  Hood's Song of the Shirt, and to think that all the time she does not  understand what it is all about--a tragedy grown inconceivable to her  and her listeners. Think of that, if you can, and of how glorious life  is grown!""    ""Indeed,"" said I, ""it is difficult for me to think of it.""    And I sat watching how his eyes glittered, and how the fresh life  seemed to glow in his face, and I wondered how at his age he should  think of the happiness of the world, or indeed anything but his coming  to dinner.    ""Tell me in detail,"" said I, ""what lies east of Bloomsbury now?""    Said he: ""There are but few houses between this and the outer part of  the old city; but in the city we have a thickly-dwelling population.  Our forefathers, in the first clearing of the slums, were not in a  hurry to pull down the houses in what was called at the end of the  nineteenth century the business quarter of town, and what later got to  be known as the Swindling Kens. You see, these houses, though they  stood hideously thick on the ground, were roomy and fairly solid in  building, and clean, because they were not used for living in, but as  mere gambling booths; so the poor people from the cleared slums took  them for lodgings and dwelt there, till the folk of those days had  time to think of something better for them; so the buildings were  pulled down so gradually that people got used to living thicker on the  ground there than in most places; therefore it remains the most  populous part of London, or perhaps of all these islands. But it is  very pleasant there, partly because of the splendor of the  architecture, which goes further than what you will see elsewhere.  However, this crowding, if it may be called so, does not go further  than a street called Aldgate, a name that perhaps you may have heard  of. Beyond that the houses are scattered wide about the meadows there,  which are very beautiful, especially when you get on to the lovely  river Lea (where old Isaak Walton used to fish, you know) about the  places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which of course you will  not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there once upon a  time.""    Not heard of them! thought I to myself. How strange! that I who had  seen the very last remnant of the pleasantness of the meadows by the  Lea destroyed, should have heard them spoken of with pleasantness come  back to them in full measure.    Hammond went on: ""When you get down to the Thames side you come on the  Docks, which are works of the nineteenth century, and are still in  use, although not so thronged as they once were, since we discourage  centralisaion all we can, and we have long ago dropped the pretension  to be the market of the world. About these Docks are a good few  houses, which, however, are not inhabited by many people permanently;  I mean, those who use them come and go a good deal, the place being  too low and marshy for pleasant dwelling. Past the Docks eastward and  landward it is all flat pasture, once marsh, except for a few gardens,  and there are very few permanent dwellings there: scarcely anything  but a few sheds, and cots for the men who come to look after the great  herds of cattle pasturing there. But however, what with the beasts and  the men, and the scattered red-tiled roofs and the big hayricks, it  does not make a bad holiday to get a quiet pony and ride about there  on a sunny afternoon of autumn, and look over the river and the craft  passing up and down, and on to Shooter s' Hill and the Kentish  uplands, and then turn round to the wide green sea of the Essex  marshland, with the great domed line of the sky, and the sun shining  down in one flood of peaceful light over the long distance. There is a  place called Canning's Town, and further out, Silvertown, where the  pleasant meadows are at their pleasantest: doubtless they were once  slums, and wretched enough.""    The names grated on my ear, but I could not explain why to him. So I  said: ""And south of the river, what is it like?""    He said: ""You would find it much the same as the land about  Hammersmith. North, again, the land runs up high, and there is an  agreeable and well-built town called Hampstead, which fitly ends  London on that side. It looks down on the north-western end of the  forest you passed through.""    I smiled. ""So much for what was once London,"" said I. ""Now tell me  about the other towns of the country.""    He said: ""As to the big murky places which were once, as we know, the  centres of manufacture, they have, like the brick and mortar desert of  London, disappeared; only, since they were the centres of nothing but  `manufacture', and served no purpose but that of the gambling market,  they have left less signs of their existence than London. Of course,  the great change in the use of mechanical force made this an easy  matter, and some approach to their break-up as centres would probably  have taken place, even if we had not changed our habits so much: but  they being such as they were, no sacrifice would have seemed too great  a price to pay for getting rid of the `manufacturing districts', as  they used to be called. For the rest, whatever coal or mineral we need  is brought to grass and sent whither it is needed with as little as  possible of dirt, confusion, and the distressing of quiet people's  lives. One is tempted to believe from what one has read of the  condition of those districts in the nineteenth century, that those who  had them under their power worried, befouled, and degraded men out of  malice prepense: but it was not so; like the miseducation of which we  were talking just now, it came of their dreadful poverty. They were  obliged to put up with everything, and even pretend that they liked  it; whereas we can now deal with things reasonable, and refuse to be  saddled with what we do not want.""    I confess I was not sorry to cut short with a question his  glorifications of the age he lived in. Said I: ""How about the smaller  towns? I suppose you have swept those away entirely?""    ""No, no,"" said he, ""it hasn't gone that way. On the contrary, there  has been but little clearance, though much rebuilding in the smaller  towns. Their suburbs, indeed, when they had any, have melted away into  the general country, and space and elbow-room has been got in their  centres: but there are the towns still with their streets and squares  the market-places; so that it is by means of these smaller towns that  we of to-day can get some kind of idea of what the towns of the older  world were like;--I mean to say at their best.""    ""Take Oxford, for instance,"" said I.    ""Yes,"" said he, ""I suppose Oxford was beautiful even in the nineteenth  century. At present it has the great interest of still preserving a  great mass of precommercial building, and is a very beautiful place,  yet there are many towns which have become scarcely less beautiful.""    Said I: ""In passing, may I ask if it is still a place of learning?""    ""Still?"" said he, smiling. ""Well, it has reverted to some of its best  traditions; so you may imagine how far it is from its  nineteenth-century position. It is real learning, knowledge cultivated  for its own sake--the Art of Knowledge, in short--which is followed  there, not the Commercial learning of the past. Though perhaps you do  not know that in the nineteenth century Oxford and its less  interesting sister Cambridge became definitely commercial. They (and  especially Oxford) were the breeding places of a peculiar class of  parasites, who called themselves cultivated people; they were indeed  cynical enough, as the so-called educated classes of the day generally  were; but they affected an exaggeration of cynicism in order that they  might be thought knowing and worldly-wise. The rich middle classes  (they had no relation with the working-classes) treated them with the  kind of contemptuous toleration with which a mediaeval baron treated  his jester; though it must be said that they were by no means so  pleasant as the old jesters were, being, in fact, _the_ bores of  society. They were laughed at, despised--and paid. Which last was what  they aimed at.""    Dear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary  judgements. Surely only the worst of them were as bad as that. But I  must admit that they were mostly prigs, and they _were_ commercial. I  said aloud, though more to myself than to Hammond, ""Well, how could  they be better than the age that made them?""    ""True,"" he said, ""but their pretensions were higher.""    ""Were they?"" said I, smiling.    ""You drive me from corner to corner,"" said he, smiling in turn. ""Let  me say at least that they were a poor sequence to the aspirations of  Oxford of `the barbarous Middle Ages'.""    ""Yes, that will do,"" said I.    ""Also,"" said Hammond, ""what I have been saying of them is true in the  main. But ask on!""    I said: ""We have heard about London and the manufacturing districts  and the ordinary towns: how about the villages?""    Said Hammond: "" You must know that toward the end of the nineteenth  century the villages were almost destroyed, unless where they became  mere adjuncts to the manufacturing district themselves. Houses were  allowed to fall into decay and actual ruin; trees were cut down for  the sake of the few shillings which the poor sticks would fetch; the  building became inexpressibly mean and hideous. Labour was scarce; but  wages fell nevertheless. All the small country arts of life which once  added to the little pleasures of country people were lost. The country  produce which passed throught the hands of the husbandmen never got so  far as their mouths. Incredible shabbiness and niggardly pinching  reigned over the fields and acres which, in spite of the rude and  careless husbandry of the times, were so kind and bountiful. Had you  any inkling of all this? ""    ""I have heard that it was so,"" said I; ""but what followed?""    ""The change,"" said Hammond, ""which in these matters took place very  early in our epoch, was most strangely rapid. People flocked into the  country villages, and, so to say, flung themselves upon the freed land  like a wild beast upon his prey; and in a very little time the  villages of England were more populous than they had been since the  fourteenth century, and were still growing fast. Of course, this  invasion of the country was awkward to deal with, and would have  created much misery, if the folk had still been under the bondage of  class monopoly. But as it was, things soon righted themselves. People  found out what they were fit for, and gave up attempting to push  themselves into occupations in which they must needs fail. The town  invaded the country; but the invaders, like the warlike invaders of  early days, yielded to the influence of their surroundings, and became  country people; and in their turn, as they became more numerous than  the townsmen, influenced them also; so that the difference between  town and country grew less and less; and it was indeed this world of  town-bred folk which has produced that happy and leisurely but eager  life of which you have had a first taste. Again I say, many blunders  were made, but we have had time to set them right. Much was left for  the men of my earlier life to deal with. The crude ideas of the first  half of the twentieth century, when men were still oppressed by the  fear of poverty, and did not look enough to the present pleasure of  ordinary life, spoilt a great deal of what the commercial age had left  us of external beauty: and I admit that it was but slowly that men  recovered from the injuries they had inflicted on themselves even  after they became free. But slowly as the recovery came, it _did_  come; and the more you see of us, the clearer it will be to you that  we are happy. That we live amidst beauty without any fear of becoming  effeminate; that we have plenty to do, and on the whole enjoy doing  it. What more can we ask of life?""    He paused, as if he were seeking for words with which to express his  thought. Then he said:    ""This is how we stand. England was once a country of clearings amongst  the woods and wastes, with a few towns interspersed, which were  fortresses for the feudal army, markets for the folk, gathering places  for craftsmen. It then became a country of huge and foul workshops and  fouler gambling-dens, surrounded by an ill-kept, poverty-stricken  farm, pillaged by the masters of the workshops. It is now a garden,  where nothing is wasted and nothing is spoilt, with the necessary  dwellings, sheds, and workshops scattered up and down the country, all  trim and neat and pretty. for, indeed, we should be too much ashamed  of ourselves if we allowed the making of goods, even on a large scale,  to carry with it the appearance, even, of desolation and misery. Why  my friend, those housewives we were talking of just now would teach us  better than that.""    Said I: ""This side of your change is certainly for the better. But  though I shall soon see some of these villages, tell me in a word or  two what they are like, just to prepare me.""    ""Perhaps, "" said he, ""you have seen a tolerable picture of these  villages as they were before the end of the nineteenth century. Such  things exist.""    ""I have seen several of such pictures,"" said I.    ""Well,"" said Hammond, ""our villages are something like the best of  such places, with the church or mote-house of the neighbours for their  chief building. Only note that there are no tokens of poverty about  them: no tumble-down picturesque; which, to tell you the truth, the  artist usually availed himself of to veil his incapacity for drawing  architecture. Such things do not please us, even when they indicate no  misery. Like the mediaevals, we like everything trim and clean, and  orderly and bright; as people always do when they have any sense of  architectural power; because then they know that they can have what  they want, and they won't stand any nonsense from Nature in their  dealings with her.""    ""Besides the villages, are there any scattered country houses?"" said  I.    ""Yes, plenty,"" said Hammond; ""in fact, except in the wastes and  forests and amongst the sand-hills (like Hindhead in Surrey), it is  not easy to be out of sight of a house; and where the houses are  thinly scattered they run large, and are more like the old colleges  than ordinary houses as they used to be. That is done for the sake of  society, for a good many people can dwell in such houses, as the  country dwellers are not necessarily husbandmen; though they almost  all help in such work at times. The life that goes on in these big  dwellings in the country is very pleasant, especially as some of the  most studious men of our time live in them, and altogether there is a  great variety of mind and mood to be found in them which brightens and  quickens the society there.""    ""I am rather surprised,"" said I, ""by all this, for it seems to me that  after all the country must be tolerably populous.""    ""Certainly,"" said he; ""the population is pretty much the same as it  was at the end of the nineteenth century; we have spread it, that is  all. Of course, also, we have helped to populate other  countries--where we were wanted and were called for.""    Said I: ""One thing, it seems to me, does not go with your word of  `garden' for the country. You have spoken of wastes and forests, and I  myself have seen the beginning of your Middlesex and Essex forest. Why  do you keep such things in a garden? and isn't it very wasteful to do  so?""    ""My friend,"" he said, ""we like these pieces of wild nature, and can  afford them, so we have them; let alone that as to forests, we need a  great deal of timber, and suppose that our sons and our sons' sons  will do the like. As to the land being a garden, I have heard that  they used to have shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and  though I might not like the artificial ones, I assure you that some of  the natural rockeries of our garden are worth seeing. Go north this  summer and look at the Cumberland and Westmoreland ones,--where, by  the way, you will see some sheep feeding, so that they are not so  wasteful as you think; not so wasteful as forcing-grounds for fruit  out of season, _I_ think. Go and have a look at the sheep-walks high  up in the slopes between Ingleborough and Pen-y-gwent, and tell me if  you think we _waste_ the land there by not covering it with factories  for making things that nobody wants, which was the chief business of  the nineteenth century.""    ""I will try to go there,"" said I.    ""It won't take much trying,"" said he.  "
612,Russia,58,Donald Mackenzie Wallace,Index,"In the South Seas     	by Robert Louis Stevenson            PART 1: THE MARQUESAS            CHAPTER I - AN ISLAND LANDFALL                FOR nearly ten years my health had been declining; and for some     while before I set forth upon my voyage, I believed I was come to     the afterpiece of life, and had only the nurse and undertaker to     expect.  It was suggested that I should try the South Seas; and I     was not unwilling to visit like a ghost, and be carried like a     bale, among scenes that had attracted me in youth and health.  I     chartered accordingly Dr. Merrit's schooner yacht, the CASCO,     seventy-four tons register; sailed from San Francisco towards the     end of June 1888, visited the eastern islands, and was left early     the next year at Honolulu.  Hence, lacking courage to return to my     old life of the house and sick-room, I set forth to leeward in a     trading schooner, the EQUATOR, of a little over seventy tons, spent     four months among the atolls (low coral islands) of the Gilbert     group, and reached Samoa towards the close of '89.  By that time     gratitude and habit were beginning to attach me to the islands; I     had gained a competency of strength; I had made friends; I had     learned new interests; the time of my voyages had passed like days     in fairyland; and I decided to remain.  I began to prepare these     pages at sea, on a third cruise, in the trading steamer JANET     NICOLL.  If more days are granted me, they shall be passed where I     have found life most pleasant and man most interesting; the axes of     my black boys are already clearing the foundations of my future     house; and I must learn to address readers from the uttermost parts     of the sea.        That I should thus have reversed the verdict of Lord Tennyson's     hero is less eccentric than appears.  Few men who come to the     islands leave them; they grow grey where they alighted; the palm     shades and the trade-wind fans them till they die, perhaps     cherishing to the last the fancy of a visit home, which is rarely     made, more rarely enjoyed, and yet more rarely repeated.  No part     of the world exerts the same attractive power upon the visitor, and     the task before me is to communicate to fireside travellers some     sense of its seduction, and to describe the life, at sea and     ashore, of many hundred thousand persons, some of our own blood and     language, all our contemporaries, and yet as remote in thought and     habit as Rob Roy or Barbarossa, the Apostles or the Caesars.        The first experience can never be repeated.  The first love, the     first sunrise, the first South Sea island, are memories apart and     touched a virginity of sense.  On the 28th of July 1888 the moon     was an hour down by four in the morning.  In the east a radiating     centre of brightness told of the day; and beneath, on the skyline,     the morning bank was already building, black as ink.  We have all     read of the swiftness of the day's coming and departure in low     latitudes; it is a point on which the scientific and sentimental     tourist are at one, and has inspired some tasteful poetry.  The     period certainly varies with the season; but here is one case     exactly noted.  Although the dawn was thus preparing by four, the     sun was not up till six; and it was half-past five before we could     distinguish our expected islands from the clouds on the horizon.      Eight degrees south, and the day two hours a-coming.  The interval     was passed on deck in the silence of expectation, the customary     thrill of landfall heightened by the strangeness of the shores that     we were then approaching.  Slowly they took shape in the     attenuating darkness.  Ua-huna, piling up to a truncated summit,     appeared the first upon the starboard bow; almost abeam arose our     destination, Nuka-hiva, whelmed in cloud; and betwixt and to the     southward, the first rays of the sun displayed the needles of Ua-    pu.  These pricked about the line of the horizon; like the     pinnacles of some ornate and monstrous church, they stood there, in     the sparkling brightness of the morning, the fit signboard of a     world of wonders.        Not one soul aboard the CASCO had set foot upon the islands, or     knew, except by accident, one word of any of the island tongues;     and it was with something perhaps of the same anxious pleasure as     thrilled the bosom of discoverers that we drew near these     problematic shores.  The land heaved up in peaks and rising vales;     it fell in cliffs and buttresses; its colour ran through fifty     modulations in a scale of pearl and rose and olive; and it was     crowned above by opalescent clouds.  The suffusion of vague hues     deceived the eye; the shadows of clouds were confounded with the     articulations of the mountains; and the isle and its unsubstantial     canopy rose and shimmered before us like a single mass.  There was     no beacon, no smoke of towns to be expected, no plying pilot.      Somewhere, in that pale phantasmagoria of cliff and cloud, our     haven lay concealed; and somewhere to the east of it - the only     sea-mark given - a certain headland, known indifferently as Cape     Adam and Eve, or Cape Jack and Jane, and distinguished by two     colossal figures, the gross statuary of nature.  These we were to     find; for these we craned and stared, focused glasses, and wrangled     over charts; and the sun was overhead and the land close ahead     before we found them.  To a ship approaching, like the CASCO, from     the north, they proved indeed the least conspicuous features of a     striking coast; the surf flying high above its base; strange,     austere, and feathered mountains rising behind; and Jack and Jane,     or Adam and Eve, impending like a pair of warts above the breakers.        Thence we bore away along shore.  On our port beam we might hear     the explosions of the surf; a few birds flew fishing under the     prow; there was no other sound or mark of life, whether of man or     beast, in all that quarter of the island.  Winged by her own     impetus and the dying breeze, the CASCO skimmed under cliffs,     opened out a cove, showed us a beach and some green trees, and     flitted by again, bowing to the swell.  The trees, from our     distance, might have been hazel; the beach might have been in     Europe; the mountain forms behind modelled in little from the Alps,     and the forest which clustered on their ramparts a growth no more     considerable than our Scottish heath.  Again the cliff yawned, but     now with a deeper entry; and the CASCO, hauling her wind, began to     slide into the bay of Anaho.  The cocoa-palm, that giraffe of     vegetables, so graceful, so ungainly, to the European eye so     foreign, was to be seen crowding on the beach, and climbing and     fringing the steep sides of mountains.  Rude and bare hills     embraced the inlet upon either hand; it was enclosed to the     landward by a bulk of shattered mountains.  In every crevice of     that barrier the forest harboured, roosting and nestling there like     birds about a ruin; and far above, it greened and roughened the     razor edges of the summit.        Under the eastern shore, our schooner, now bereft of any breeze,     continued to creep in:  the smart creature, when once under way,     appearing motive in herself.  From close aboard arose the bleating     of young lambs; a bird sang in the hillside; the scent of the land     and of a hundred fruits or flowers flowed forth to meet us; and,     presently, a house or two appeared, standing high upon the ankles     of the hills, and one of these surrounded with what seemed a     garden.  These conspicuous habitations, that patch of culture, had     we but known it, were a mark of the passage of whites; and we might     have approached a hundred islands and not found their parallel.  It     was longer ere we spied the native village, standing (in the     universal fashion) close upon a curve of beach, close under a grove     of palms; the sea in front growling and whitening on a concave arc     of reef.  For the cocoa-tree and the island man are both lovers and     neighbours of the surf.  'The coral waxes, the palm grows, but man     departs,' says the sad Tahitian proverb; but they are all three, so     long as they endure, co-haunters of the beach.  The mark of     anchorage was a blow-hole in the rocks, near the south-easterly     corner of the bay.  Punctually to our use, the blow-hole spouted;     the schooner turned upon her heel; the anchor plunged.  It was a     small sound, a great event; my soul went down with these moorings     whence no windlass may extract nor any diver fish it up; and I, and     some part of my ship's company, were from that hour the bondslaves     of the isles of Vivien.        Before yet the anchor plunged a canoe was already paddling from the     hamlet.  It contained two men:  one white, one brown and tattooed     across the face with bands of blue, both in immaculate white     European clothes:  the resident trader, Mr. Regler, and the native     chief, Taipi-Kikino.  'Captain, is it permitted to come on board?'     were the first words we heard among the islands.  Canoe followed     canoe till the ship swarmed with stalwart, six-foot men in every     stage of undress; some in a shirt, some in a loin-cloth, one in a     handkerchief imperfectly adjusted; some, and these the more     considerable, tattooed from head to foot in awful patterns; some     barbarous and knived; one, who sticks in my memory as something     bestial, squatting on his hams in a canoe, sucking an orange and     spitting it out again to alternate sides with ape-like vivacity -     all talking, and we could not understand one word; all trying to     trade with us who had no thought of trading, or offering us island     curios at prices palpably absurd.  There was no word of welcome; no     show of civility; no hand extended save that of the chief and Mr.     Regler.  As we still continued to refuse the proffered articles,     complaint ran high and rude; and one, the jester of the party,     railed upon our meanness amid jeering laughter.  Amongst other     angry pleasantries - 'Here is a mighty fine ship,' said he, 'to     have no money on board!'  I own I was inspired with sensible     repugnance; even with alarm.  The ship was manifestly in their     power; we had women on board; I knew nothing of my guests beyond     the fact that they were cannibals; the Directory (my only guide)     was full of timid cautions; and as for the trader, whose presence     might else have reassured me, were not whites in the Pacific the     usual instigators and accomplices of native outrage?  When he reads     this confession, our kind friend, Mr. Regler, can afford to smile.        Later in the day, as I sat writing up my journal, the cabin was     filled from end to end with Marquesans:  three brown-skinned     generations, squatted cross-legged upon the floor, and regarding me     in silence with embarrassing eyes.  The eyes of all Polynesians are     large, luminous, and melting; they are like the eyes of animals and     some Italians.  A kind of despair came over me, to sit there     helpless under all these staring orbs, and be thus blocked in a     corner of my cabin by this speechless crowd:  and a kind of rage to     think they were beyond the reach of articulate communication, like     furred animals, or folk born deaf, or the dwellers of some alien     planet.        To cross the Channel is, for a boy of twelve, to change heavens; to     cross the Atlantic, for a man of twenty-four, is hardly to modify     his diet.  But I was now escaped out of the shadow of the Roman     empire, under whose toppling monuments we were all cradled, whose     laws and letters are on every hand of us, constraining and     preventing.  I was now to see what men might be whose fathers had     never studied Virgil, had never been conquered by Caesar, and never     been ruled by the wisdom of Gaius or Papinian.  By the same step I     had journeyed forth out of that comfortable zone of kindred     languages, where the curse of Babel is so easy to be remedied; and     my new fellow-creatures sat before me dumb like images.  Methought,     in my travels, all human relation was to be excluded; and when I     returned home (for in those days I still projected my return) I     should have but dipped into a picture-book without a text.  Nay,     and I even questioned if my travels should be much prolonged;     perhaps they were destined to a speedy end; perhaps my subsequent     friend, Kauanui, whom I remarked there, sitting silent with the     rest, for a man of some authority, might leap from his hams with an     ear-splitting signal, the ship be carried at a rush, and the ship's     company butchered for the table.        There could be nothing more natural than these apprehensions, nor     anything more groundless.  In my experience of the islands, I had     never again so menacing a reception; were I to meet with such to-    day, I should be more alarmed and tenfold more surprised.  The     majority of Polynesians are easy folk to get in touch with, frank,     fond of notice, greedy of the least affection, like amiable,     fawning dogs; and even with the Marquesans, so recently and so     imperfectly redeemed from a blood-boltered barbarism, all were to     become our intimates, and one, at least, was to mourn sincerely our     departure.    "
617,Selected Stories,36,Bret Harte,The Outcasts Of Poker Flat,"CHAPTER 19.          IT WAS for reasons connected with this determination that on the    morrow he sought a few words of private conversation with Mrs.    Penniman. He sent for her to the library, and he there informed her    that he hoped very much that, as regarded this affair of    Catherine's, she would mind her p's and q's.      ""I don't know what you mean by such an expression,"" said his sister.    ""You speak as if I were learning the alphabet.""      ""The alphabet of common sense is something you will never learn,""    the doctor permitted himself to respond.      ""Have you called me here to insult me?"" Mrs. Penniman inquired.      ""Not at all. Simply to advise you. You have taken up young Townsend;    that's your own affair. I have nothing to do with your sentiments,    your fancies, your affections, your delusions; but what I request of    you is that you will keep these things to yourself. I have explained    my views to Catherine; she understands them perfectly, and anything    that she does further in the way of encouraging Mr. Townsend's    attentions will be in deliberate opposition to my wishes. Anything    that you should do in the way of giving her aid and comfort will be-    permit me the expression- distinctly treasonable. You know high    treason is a capital offense: Take care how you incur the penalty.""      Mrs. Penniman threw back her head, with a certain expansion of the    eye which she occasionally practiced. ""It seems to me that you talk    like a great autocrat.""      ""I talk like my daughter's father.""      ""Not like your sister's brother,"" cried Lavinia.      ""My dear Lavinia,"" said the doctor, ""I sometimes wonder whether I am    your brother, we are so extremely different. In spite of    differences, however, we can, at a pinch, understand each other; and    that is the essential thing just now. Walk straight with regard to Mr.    Townsend; that's all I ask. It is highly probable you have been    corresponding with him for the last three weeks- perhaps even seeing    him. I don't ask you- you needn't tell me."" He had a moral    conviction that she would contrive to tell a fib about the matter,    which it would disgust him to listen to. ""Whatever you have done, stop    doing it; that's all I wish.""      ""Don't you wish also by chance to murder your child?"" Mrs.    Penniman inquired.      ""On the contrary, I wish to make her live and be happy.""      ""You will kill her: She passed a dreadful night.""      ""She won't die of one dreadful night, nor of a dozen. Remember    that I am a distinguished physician.""      Mrs. Penniman hesitated a moment; then she risked her retort.    ""Your being a distinguished physician has not prevented you from    already losing two members of your family.""      She had risked it, but her brother gave her such a terribly incisive    look- a look so like a surgeon's lancet- that she was frightened at    her courage. And he answered her, in words that corresponded to the    look, ""It may not prevent me, either, from losing the society of still    another.""      Mrs. Penniman took herself off with whatever air of depreciated    merit was at her command, and repaired to Catherine's room, where    the poor girl was closeted. She knew all about her dreadful night, for    the two had met again, the evening before, after Catherine left her    father. Mrs. Penniman was on the landing of the second floor when    her niece came upstairs; it was not remarkable that a person of so    much subtlety should have discovered that Catherine had been shut up    with the doctor. It was still less remarkable that she should have    felt an extreme curiosity to learn the result of this interview, and    that this sentiment, combined with her great amiability and    generosity, should have prompted her to regret the sharp words    lately exchanged between her niece and herself. As the unhappy girl    came into sight in the dusky corridor, she made a lively demonstration    of sympathy. Catherine's bursting heart was equally oblivious; she    only knew that her aunt was taking her into her arms. Mrs. Penniman    drew her into Catherine's own room, and the two women sat there    together far into the small hours, the younger one with her head on    the other's lap, sobbing, and sobbing at first in a soundless, stifled    manner, and then at last perfectly still. It gratified Mrs. Penniman    to be able to feel conscientiously that this scene virtually removed    the interdict which Catherine had placed upon her indulging in further    communion with Morris Townsend. She was not gratified, however,    when, in coming back to her niece's room before breakfast, she found    that Catherine had risen and was preparing herself for this meal.      ""You should not go to breakfast,"" she said. ""You are not well    enough, after your fearful night.""      ""Yes, I am very well, and I am only afraid of being late.""      ""I can't understand you,"" Mrs. Penniman cried. ""You should stay in    bed for three days.""      ""Oh, I could never do that,"" said Catherine, to whom this idea    presented no attractions.      Mrs. Penniman was in despair; and she noted, with extreme annoyance,    that the trace of the night's tears had completely vanished from    Catherine's eyes. She had a most impracticable physique. ""What    effect do you expect to have upon your father,"" her aunt demanded, ""if    you come plumping down, without a vestige of any sort of feeling, as    if nothing in the world had happened?""      ""He would not like me to lie in bed,"" said Catherine, simply.      ""All the more reason for your doing it. How else do you expect to    move him?""      Catherine thought a little. ""I don't know how; but not in that    way. I wish to be just as usual."" And she finished dressing- and,    according to her aunt's expression, went plumping down into the    paternal presence. She was really too modest for consistent pathos.      And yet it was perfectly true that she had had a dreadful night.    Even after Mrs. Penniman left her she had had no sleep; she lay    staring at the uncomforting gloom, with her eyes and ears filled    with the movement with which her father had turned her out of his    room, and of the words in which he had told her that she was a    heartless daughter. Her heart was breaking; she had heart enough for    that. At moments it seemed to her that she believed him, and that to    do what she was doing a girl must indeed be bad. She was bad; but    she couldn't help it. She would try to appear good, even if her    heart were perverted; and from time to time she had a fancy that she    might accomplish something by ingenious concessions to form, though    she should persist in caring for Morris. Catherine's ingenuities    were indefinite, and we are not called upon to expose their    hollowness. The best of them, perhaps, showed itself in that freshness    of aspect which was so discouraging to Mrs. Penniman, who was amazed    at the absence of haggardness in a young woman who for a whole night    had lain quivering beneath a father's curse. Poor Catherine was    conscious of her freshness; it gave her a feeling about the future    which rather added to the weight upon her mind. It seemed a proof that    she was strong and solid and dense, and would live to a great age-    longer than might be generally convenient; and this idea was pressing,    for it appeared to saddle her with a pretension the more, just when    the cultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her doing    right. She wrote that day to Morris Townsend, requesting him to come    and see her on the morrow, using very few words, and explaining    nothing. She would explain everything face to face.  "
645,Summer,61,Edith Wharton  ,Chapter05,"chapter03         Chapter 3   Later on in the afternoon, before the others arrived, the form of their  reunion was at least remarkable: they might in their great eastward drawing-room  have been comparing notes or nerves under menace of some stiff official  visit. Maggie's mind, in its restlessness, even played a little with the  prospect; the high cool room in its afternoon shade, its old tapestries  uncovered, the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of  gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared tea-table, drew  from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored, as well as something  else in the Prince's movement while he slowly paced and turned. ""We're  distinctly bourgeois!"" she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their  old community; though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have  been quite the privileged pair they were reputed, granted only they were  taken as awaiting the visit of Royalty. They might have been ready, on  the word passed up in advance, to repair together to the foot of the staircase--the  Prince somewhat in front, advancing indeed to the open doors and even going  down, for all his princedom, to meet, on the stopping of the chariot, the  august emergence The time was stale, it was to be admitted, for incidents  of magnitude; the September hush was in full possession at the end of the  dull day, and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that  (355) overhung the desolation--the balcony from which Maggie, in the springtime,  had seen Amerigo and Charlotte look down together at the hour of her return  from the Regent's Park, near by, with her father, the Principino and Miss  Bogle. Amerigo now again, in his punctual impatience, went out a couple  of times and stood there; after which, as to report that nothing was in  sight, he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do. The Princess  pretended to read; he looked at her as he passed; there hovered in her  own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances  of agitation with a book. At last she felt him standing before her and  then raised her eyes.    ""Do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event I asked  you if there were anything particular you wished me to do? You spoke of  my being at home, but that was a matter of course. You spoke of something  else,"" he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised  eyes; ""something that makes me almost wish it may happen. You spoke,"" he  said, ""of the possibility of my seeing her alone. Do you know, if that  comes,"" he asked, ""the use I shall make of it?"" And then as she waited:  ""The use is all before me.""    ""Ah it's your own business now!"" said his wife. But it had made her  rise.    ""I shall make it my own,"" he answered. ""I shall tell her I lied to her.""    ""Ah no!"" she returned.    ""And I shall tell her you did.""    She shook her head again. ""Oh still less!""    (356) With which therefore they stood at difference, he with his head  erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest. ""And how  then is she to know?""    ""She is n't to know.""    ""She's only still to think you don't--?""    ""And therefore that I'm always a fool? She may think,"" said Maggie,  ""what she likes.""    ""Think it without my protest--?""    The Princess made a movement. ""What business is it of yours?""    ""Is n't it my right to correct her--?""    Maggie let his question ring--ring long enough for him to hear it himself;  only then she took it up. ""'Correct' her?""--and it was her own now that  really rang. ""Are n't you rather forgetting who she is?"" After which, while  he quite stared for it, as it was the very first clear majesty he had known  her to use, she flung down her book and raised a warning hand. ""The carriage.  Come!""    The ""Come!"" had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech, and  when they were below in the hall there was a ""Go!"" for him, through the  open doors and between the ranged servants, that matched even that. He  received Royalty, bareheaded, therefore, in the persons of Mr. and Mrs.  Verver, as it alighted on the pavement, and Maggie was at the threshold  to welcome it to her house. Later on, upstairs again, she even herself  felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him;  at tea, in Charlotte's affirmed presence--as Charlotte affirmed it--she  drew a long breath of richer relief. It was the (357) strangest, once more,  of all impressions; but what she most felt for the half-hour was that Mr.  and Mrs. Verver were making the occasion easy. They were somehow conjoined  in it, conjoined for a present effect as Maggie had absolutely never yet  seen them; and there occurred, before long, a moment in which Amerigo's  look met her own in recognitions that he could n't suppress. The question  of the amount of correction to which Charlotte had laid herself open rose  and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight;  so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions,  so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making. The shade of  the official, in her beauty and security, never for a moment dropped; it  was a cool high refuge, the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded  image, in which she sat and smiled and waited, drank her tea, referred  to her husband and remembered her mission. Her mission had quite taken  form--it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity:  that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar  off and in ignorance. Maggie had sufficiently intimated to the Prince ten  minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend would  n't consent to be taken for; but the difficulty now indeed was to choose,  for explicit tribute of admiration, between the varieties of her nobler  aspects. She carried it off, to put the matter coarsely, with a taste and  a discretion that held our young woman's attention, for the first quarter  of an hour, to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her  overshadowed, her almost superseded companion. But (358) Adam Verver profited  indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity  of seeming on no occasion to HAVE an attitude; and so long as they were  in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out  his long fine cord, knew herself in presence of this tacit process very  much as she had known herself at Fawns. He had a way, the dear man, wherever  he was, of moving about the room, noiselessly, to see what it might contain;  and his manner of now resorting to this habit, acquainted as he already  was with the objects in view, expressed with a certain sharpness the intention  of leaving his wife to her devices. It did even more than this; it signified,  to the apprehension of the Princess, from the moment she more directly  took thought of him, almost a special view of these devices, as actually  exhibited in their rarity, together with an independent, a settled appreciation  of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment  of his faint contemplative hum.    Charlotte throned, as who should say, between her hostess and her host,  the whole scene having crystallised, as soon as she took her place, to  the right quiet lustre; the harmony was n't less sustained for being superficial,  and the only approach to a break in it was while Amerigo remained standing  long enough for his father-in-law, vaguely wondering, to appeal to him,  invite or address him, and then in default of any such word selected for  presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours. Maggie watched  her husband--if it now could be called watching--offer this refreshment;  she noted the consummate (359) way--for ""consummate"" was the term she privately  applied--in which Charlotte cleared her acceptance, cleared her impersonal  smile, of any betrayal, any slightest value, of consciousness; and then  felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two  had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a  picture, an early Florentine sacred subject, that he had given her on her  marriage. He might have been in silence taking his last leave of it; it  was a work for which she knew he entertained an unqualified esteem. The  tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had  become to her sense a part of the whole infusion, of the immortal expression;  the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always, from the beauty of  the rest, as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face:  she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing  behind him, held as in her clasping arms, he was doing the most possible  toward leaving her a part of his palpable self. She put her hand over his  shoulder, and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity;  they smiled in emulation, vaguely, as if speech failed them through their  having passed too far: she would have begun to wonder the next minute if  it were reserved to them, for the last stage, to find their contact, like  that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged, subject  to shy lapses.    ""It's all right, eh?""    ""Oh my dear--rather!""    He had applied the question to the great fact of the picture, as she  had spoken for the picture in reply, (360) but it was as if their words  for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth, so that they looked  about at everything else to give them this extension. She had passed her  arm into his, and the other objects in the room, the other pictures, the  sofas, the chairs, the tables, the cabinets, the ""important"" pieces, supreme  in their way, stood out, round them, consciously, for recognition and applause.  Their eyes moved together from piece to piece, taking in the whole nobleness--quite  as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas. The two noble persons  seated in conversation and at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and  the general harmony: Mrs. Verver and the Prince fairly ""placed"" themselves,  however unwittingly, as high expressions of the kind of human furniture  required aesthetically by such a scene. The fusion of their presence with  the decorative elements, their contribution to the triumph of selection,  was complete and admirable; though to a lingering view, a view more penetrating  than the occasion really demanded, they also might have figured as concrete  attestations of a rare power of purchase. There was much indeed in the  tone in which Adam Verver spoke again, and who shall say where his thought  stopped? ""Le compte y est. You've got some good things.""    Maggie met it afresh--""Ah don't they look well?"" Their companions, at  the sound of this, gave them, in a spacious intermission of slow talk,  an attention, all of gravity, that was like an ampler submission to the  general duty of magnificence; sitting as still, to be thus appraised, as  a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms (361)  of Madame Tussaud. ""I'm so glad--for your last look.""    With which, after Maggie--quite in the air--had said it, the note was  struck indeed; the note of that strange accepted finality of relation,  as from couple to couple, which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not  attempting a gloss. Yes, this was the wonder, that the occasion defied  insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealt--so  that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting. To do such  an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds--which  was why they remained in fine, the four of them, in the upper air, united  through the firmest abstention from pressure. There was visibly no point  at which, face to face, either Amerigo or Charlotte had pressed; and how  little she herself was in danger of doing so Maggie scarce needed to remember.  That her father would n't by the tip of a toe--of that she was equally  conscious: the only thing was that since he did n't she could but hold  her breath for what he would do instead. When at the end of three minutes  more he had said, with an effect of suddenness, ""Well, Mag--and the Principino?""  it was quite as if THAT were by contrast the hard, the truer voice.    She glanced at the clock. ""I 'ordered' him for half-past five--which  has n't yet struck. Trust him, my dear, not to fail you!""    ""Oh I don't want HIM to fail me!"" was Mr. Verver's reply; yet uttered  in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that  even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one (362) of  the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for  a few seconds whether reality, should she follow him, would overtake or  meet her there. She followed him of necessity--it came absolutely so near  to his inviting her, by stepping off into temporary detachment, to give  the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically  discussed. Beside him then, while they hung over the great dull place,  clear and almost coloured now, coloured with the odd sad pictured ""old-fashioned""  look that empty London streets take on in waning afternoons of the summer's  end, she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to  them, how it would have torn them to pieces, if they had so much as suffered  its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes. This danger would doubtless  indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of each--she  could certainly at least answer for her own--had n't so successfully acted  to trump up other apparent connexions for it, connexions as to which they  could pretend to be frank.    ""You mustn't stay on here, you know,"" Adam Verver said as a result of  his unobstructed outlook. ""Fawns is all there for you of course--to the  end of my tenure. But Fawns so dismantled,"" he added with mild ruefulness,  ""Fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed, won't seem  to you, I'm afraid, particularly lively.""    ""No,"" Maggie answered, ""we should miss its best things. Its best things,  my dear, have certainly been removed. To be back there,"" she went on, ""to  be (363) back there--!"" And she paused for the force of her idea.    ""Oh to be back there without anything good--!""    But she did n't hesitate now; she brought her idea forth. ""To be back  there without Charlotte is more than I think would do."" And as she smiled  at him with it, so she saw him the next instant take it--take it in a way  that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she did n't and  could n't say. This quantity was too clear--that she could n't at such  an hour be pretending to name to him what it was, as he would have said,  ""going to be,"" at Fawns or anywhere else, to want for HIM. That was now--and  in a manner exaltedly, sublimely--out of their compass and their question;  so that what was she doing while they waited for the Principino, while  they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened,  what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute? Nothing  was stranger moreover, under the action of Charlotte's presence, than the  fact of a felt sincerity in her words. She felt her sincerity absolutely  sound--she gave it for all it might mean. ""Because Charlotte, dear, you  know,"" she said, ""is incomparable."" It took thirty seconds, but she was  to feel when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest  words of her life. They had turned from the view of the street; they leaned  together against the balcony rail, with the room largely in sight from  where they stood, but with the Prince and Mrs. Verver out of range. Nothing  he could try, she immediately saw, was to keep his eyes from lighting;  not even his taking out his cigarette-case (364) and saying before he said  anything else: ""May I smoke?"" She met it for encouragement with her ""My  dear!"" again, and then while he struck his match she had just another minute  to be nervous--a minute that she made use of however not in the least to  falter, but to reiterate with a high ring, a ring that might, for all she  cared, reach the pair inside: ""Father, father--Charlotte's great!""    It was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her. ""Charlotte's  great.""    They could close upon it--such a basis as they might immediately feel  it make; and so they stood together over it quite gratefully, each recording  to the other's eyes that it was firm under their feet. They had even thus  a renewed wait as for proof of it; much as if he were letting her see,  while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions, that this was  finally just why--but just WHY! ""You see,"" he presently added, ""how right  I was. Right, I mean, to do it for you.""    ""Ah rather!"" she murmured with her smile. And then as to be herself  ideally right: ""I don't see what you would have done without her.""    ""The point was,"" he returned quietly, ""that I did n't see what YOU were  to do. Yet it was a risk.""    ""It was a risk,"" said Maggie--""but I believed in it. At least for myself!""  she smiled.    ""Well NOW,"" he smoked, ""we see.""    ""We see.""    ""I know her better.""    ""You know her best.""    ""Oh but naturally!"" On which, as the warranted (365) truth of it hung  in the air--the truth warranted, as who should say, exactly by the present  opportunity to pronounce, this opportunity created and accepted--she found  herself lost, though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known,  in the vision of all he might mean. The sense of it in her rose higher,  rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger; and when,  after a little more, he had said, smoking again and looking up, with head  thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail, at the grey gaunt front  of the house, ""She's beautiful, beautiful!"" her sensibility reported to  her the shade of a new note. It was all she might have wished, for it was,  with a kind of speaking competence, the note of possession and control;  and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of  their parting. They were parting, in the light of it, absolutely on Charlotte's  VALUE--the value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped  as if to give it play, and with which the Prince on his side was perhaps  making larger acquaintance. If Maggie had desired at so late an hour some  last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal, she  might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest  upon high values. Somehow, when all was said, and with the memory of her  gifts, her variety, her power, so much remained of Charlotte's! What else  had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great?  Great for the world that was before her--THAT he proposed she should be:  she was n't to be wasted in the application of his plan. Maggie held to  this then--that she (366) was n't to be wasted. To let his daughter know  it he had sought this brief privacy. What a blessing accordingly that she  could speak her joy in it! His face meanwhile at all events was turned  to her, and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight. ""It's success,  father.""    ""It's success. And even THIS,"" he added as the Principino, appearing  alone, deep within, piped across an instant greeting--""even this is n't  altogether failure!""    They went in to receive the boy, upon whose introduction to the room  by Miss Bogle Charlotte and the Prince got up--seemingly with an impressiveness  that had caused Miss Bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance.  She had retired, but the Principino's presence by itself sufficiently broke  the tension--the subsidence of which, in the great room, ten minutes later,  gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a  sustained rattle. Stillness, when the Prince and Princess returned from  attending the visitors to their carriage, might have been said to be not  so much restored as created; so that whatever next took place in it was  foredoomed to remarkable salience. That would have been the case even with  so natural, though so futile, a movement as Maggie's going out to the balcony  again to follow with her eyes her father's departure. The carriage was  out of sight--it had taken her too long solemnly to reascend, and she looked  a while only at the great grey space on which, as on the room still more,  the shadow of dusk had fallen. Here at first her husband had n't rejoined  (367) her; he had come up with the boy, who, clutching his hand, abounded,  as usual, in remarks worthy of the family archives; but the two appeared  then to have proceeded to report to Miss Bogle. It meant something for  the Princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way, not  bringing him back to his mother; but everything now, as she vaguely moved  about, struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled. Yet  THIS above all--her just being there as she was and waiting for him to  come in, their freedom to be together there always--was the meaning most  disengaged: she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where  it lurked her reason for what she had done. She knew at last really why--and  how she had been inspired and guided, how she had been persistently able,  how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end. Here  it was then, the moment, the golden fruit that had shone from afar; only  what WERE these things in the fact, for the hand and for the lips, when  tested, when tasted--what were they as a reward? Closer than she had ever  been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act, she had  an instant of the terror that, when there has been suspense, always precedes,  on the part of the creature to be paid, the certification of the amount.  Amerigo knew it, the amount; he still held it, and the delay in his return,  making her heart beat too fast to go on, was like a sudden blinding light  on a wild speculation. She had thrown the dice, but his hand was over her  cast.    He opened the door however at last--he had n't (368) been away ten minutes;  and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have  a view of the number. His presence alone, as he paused to look at her,  somehow made it the highest, and even before he had spoken she had begun  to be paid in full. With that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing  occurred; the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already  within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety, for  everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his  face. So far as seeing that she was ""paid"" went he might have been holding  out the money-bag for her to come and take it. But what instantly rose  for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must  strike him as waiting for a confession. This in turn charged her with a  new horror: if THAT was her proper payment she would go without money.  His acknowledgement hung there, too monstrously, at the expense of Charlotte,  before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled.  All she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to  the uttered word; all, that is, but that she might dispose of it on the  spot for ever.    ""Is n't she too splendid?"" she simply said, offering it to explain and  to finish.    ""Oh splendid!"" With which he came over to her.    ""That's our help, you see,"" she added--to point further her moral.    It kept him before her therefore, taking in--or trying to--what she  so wonderfully gave. He tried, too clearly, to please her--to meet her  in her own (369) way; but with the result only that, close to her, her  face kept before him, his hands holding her shoulders, his whole act enclosing  her, he presently echoed: ""'See'? I see nothing but YOU."" And the truth  of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes  that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast.             End     "
646,Susan Lenox-her Rise And Fall,53,David Graham Phillips,Index,"CHAPTER V        AT A VENTURE        The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked    by no special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed    the wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence    we might place in him.        The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers,    from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.    But one of them, the captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had    shipped on board the Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing    a whale they had in sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing    Ned Land at work, gave him permission to go on board the Monroe.    And fate served our Canadian so well that, instead of one whale,    he harpooned two with a double blow, striking one straight to the heart,    and catching the other after some minutes' pursuit.        Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon,    I would not bet in its favour.        The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great rapidity.    The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of Magellan, level with    Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not take a tortuous passage,    but doubled Cape Horn.        The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible    that they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.    Many of the sailors affirmed that the monster could not pass there,    ""that he was too big for that!""        The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham Lincoln,    at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,    this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which    some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.    The course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw    of the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.        ""Keep your eyes open!"" called out the sailors.        And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,    it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not    an instant's repose.        I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least    attentive on board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals,    but a few hours to sleep, indifferent to either rain or sunshine,    I did not leave the poop of the vessel.  Now leaning on the netting    of the forecastle, now on the taffrail, I devoured with eagerness    the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as the eye could reach;    and how often have I shared the emotion of the majority of the crew,    when some capricious whale raised its black back above the waves!    The poop of the vessel was crowded on a moment.  The cabins    poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers, each with heaving    breast and troubled eye watching the course of the cetacean.    I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil kept    repeating in a calm voice:        ""If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!""        But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made    for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot,    which soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.        But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under    the most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia,    the July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe,    but the sea was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.        The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude,    and the 27th of the same month we crossed the Equator on the 110th meridian.    This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly direction,    and scoured the central waters of the Pacific.  Commander Farragut thought,    and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep water, and keep    clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself seemed to shun    (perhaps because there was not enough water for him! suggested    the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some distance from    the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the tropic of Cancer,    and made for the China Seas.  We were on the theatre of the last diversions    of the monster:  and, to say truth, we no longer LIVED on board.    The entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous excitement, of which I    can give no idea:  they could not eat, they could not sleep--twenty times    a day, a misconception or an optical illusion of some sailor seated    on the taffrail, would cause dreadful perspirations, and these emotions,    twenty times repeated, kept us in a state of excitement so violent that a    reaction was unavoidable.        And truly, reaction soon showed itself.  For three months,    during which a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed    all the waters of the Northern Pacific, running at whales,    making sharp deviations from her course, veering suddenly    from one tack to another, stopping suddenly, putting on steam,    and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging her machinery,    and not one point of the Japanese or American coast    was left unexplored.        The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most    ardent detractors.  Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself,    and certainly, had it not been for the resolute determination on the part    of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward.    This useless search could not last much longer.  The Abraham Lincoln    had nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.    Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience;    its failure could not be placed to their charge--there remained nothing    but to return.        This was represented to the commander.  The sailors could    not hide their discontent, and the service suffered.    I will not say there was a mutiny on board, but after a reasonable    period of obstinacy, Captain Farragut (as Columbus did)    asked for three days' patience.  If in three days the monster did    not appear, the man at the helm should give three turns of the wheel,    and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European seas.        This promise was made on the 2nd of November.  It had the effect of    rallying the ship's crew.  The ocean was watched with renewed attention.    Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance.    Glasses were used with feverish activity.  It was a grand defiance    given to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to answer    the summons and ""appear.""        Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand    schemes were tried to attract the attention and stimulate    the apathy of the animal in case it should be met in those parts.    Large quantities of bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship,    to the great satisfaction (I must say) of the sharks.    Small craft radiated in all directions round the Abraham Lincoln    as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of the sea unexplored.    But the night of the 4th of November arrived without the unveiling of    this submarine mystery.        The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would    (morally speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut,    faithful to his promise, was to turn the course to the south-east    and abandon for ever the northern regions of the Pacific.        The frigate was then in 31@ 15' N. lat.  and 136@ 42' E. long.    The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to leeward.    Night was approaching.  They had just struck eight bells;    large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter.    The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.        At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting.    Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him.    The crew, perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon which    contracted and darkened by degrees.  Officers with their night    glasses scoured the growing darkness:  sometimes the ocean sparkled    under the rays of the moon, which darted between two clouds,    then all trace of light was lost in the darkness.        In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little    of the general influence.  At least I thought so.  Perhaps for    the first time his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.        ""Come, Conseil,"" said I, ""this is the last chance of pocketing    the two thousand dollars.""        ""May I be permitted to say, sir,"" replied Conseil, ""that I never reckoned    on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union offered a hundred    thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer.""        ""You are right, Conseil.  It is a foolish affair after all, and one upon    which we entered too lightly.  What time lost, what useless emotions!    We should have been back in France six months ago.""        ""In your little room, sir,"" replied Conseil, ""and in your museum, sir; and I    should have already classed all your fossils, sir.  And the Babiroussa would    have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des Plantes, and have drawn    all the curious people of the capital!""        ""As you say, Conseil.  I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being    laughed at for our pains.""        ""That's tolerably certain,"" replied Conseil, quietly; ""I think    they will make fun of you, sir.  And, must I say it----?""        ""Go on, my good friend.""        ""Well, sir, you will only get your deserts.""        ""Indeed!""        ""When one has the honour of being a savant as you are, sir, one should    not expose one's self to----""        Conseil had not time to finish his compliment.    In the midst of general silence a voice had just been heard.    It was the voice of Ned Land shouting:        ""Look out there!  The very thing we are looking for--    on our weather beam!""    "
661,Ten Years Later,7,Alexandre Dumas,Chapter89,"CHAPTER XIX   IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER, AND WHAT  COMES OF IT.  Hong Kong is an island which came into the pas session of the English  by the treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonizing genius  of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port.  The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated  by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite  coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade,  and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its  depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral,  a government house, macadamized streets give to Hong Kong the appearance  of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.    Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria  port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance,  and the groups of Chinese, Japanese and Europeans who passed to and fro  in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta and  Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English  supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all  nations: English, French, American and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels,  Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas and flower-boats, which formed  so many floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number  of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going  into a barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all  at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow,  which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why,  thought this very funny.    On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the `Carnatic', he  was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed  very much disturbed and disappointed.    `This is bad,' muttered Passepartout, `for the gentlemen of the Reform  Club!' He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that  gentleman's chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh  against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was  certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong  for several days; and this being the last English territory on Mr Fogg's  route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him.    `Well, Monsieur Fix,' said Passepartout, `have you decided to go on  with us as far as America?'    `Yes,' returned Fix, through his set teeth. `Good!' exclaimed Passepartout,  laughing heartily. `I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate  from us. Come and engage your berth.'    They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons.  The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs  on the `Carnatic' having been completed, the steamer would leave that very  evening, and not next morning as had been announced.    `That will suit my master all the better,' said Passepartout. `I will  go and let him know.'    Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout  all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several  days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern  which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in  a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large campbed  furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep.  At the same tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers  were drinking English beer, porter, gin and brandy; smoking, the while,  long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence  of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic,  would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head  and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported  twenty of these stupefied sots.    Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by  those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures, to whom the English merchants  sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million  four hundred thousand pounds - thousands devoted to one of the most despicable  vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted  to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich,  to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and  then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at  all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed  to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible  bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight  pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that  Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves.  Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the  hope of returning the obligation at some future time.    They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice,  whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted about the journey,  and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to  continue it with them. When the bottles were empty, however, he rose to  go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the  `Carnatic'.    Fix caught him by the arm, and said, `Wait a moment.'    `What for, Mr Fix?'    `I want to have a serious talk with you.'    `A serious talk!' cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that  was left in the bottom of his glass. `Well, we'll talk about it to-morrow;  I haven't time now.'    `Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.'    Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix's face  seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.    `What is it that you have to say?'    Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering his voice,  said, `You have guessed who I am?'    `Parbleu!' said Passepartout, smiling. `Then I'm going to tell you everything--'    `Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that's very good. But go  on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put  themselves to a useless expense.'    `Useless!' said Fix. `You speak confidently. It's clear that you don't  know how large the sum is.'    `Of course I do,' returned Passepartout. `Twenty thousand pounds.'    `Fifty-five thousand!' answered Fix, pressing his companion's hand.    `What!' cried the Frenchman. `Has Monsieur Fogg dared - fifty-five thousand  pounds! Well, there's all the more reason for not losing an instant,' he  continued, getting up hastily.    Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: `Fifty-five  thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you'll  help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them.'    `Help you?' cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.    `Yes; help me keep Mr Fogg here for two or three days.'    `Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following  my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles  in his way! I blush for them!'    `What do you mean?'    `I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well  waylay Mr Fogg and put his money in their pockets!'    `That's just what we count on doing.'    `It's a conspiracy, then,' cried Passepartout, who became more and more  excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving  it. `A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!'    Fix began to be puzzled.    `Members of the Reform Club!' continued Passepartout. `You must know,  Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes  a wager, he tries to win it fairly!'    `But who do you think I am?' asked Fix, looking at him intently.    `Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here  to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I found you out some time  ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr Fogg.'    `He knows nothing, then?'    `Nothing,' replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.    The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before  he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake seemed sincere,  but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant  was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.    `Well,' said the detective to himself, `as he is not an accomplice,  he will help me.'    He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved  to make a clean breast of it.    `Listen to me,' said Fix abruptly. `I am not, as you think, an agent  of the members of the Reform Club--'    `Bah!' retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.    `I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.'    `You, a detective?'    `I will prove it. Here is my commission.'    Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this  document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.    `Mr Fogg's wager,' resumed Fix, `is only a pretext, of which you and  the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing your  innocent complicity.'    `But why?'    `Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand  pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description  was fortunately secured. Here is this description; it answers exactly to  that of Mr Phileas Fogg.'    `What nonsense!' cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist.  `My master is the most honourable of men!'    `How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went into  his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext,  without trunks, and carrying a large amount in bank-notes. And yet you  are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!'    `Yes, yes,' repeated the poor fellow, mechanically. `Would you like  to be arrested as his accomplice?' Passepartout, overcome by what he had  heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the  detective. Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous  man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout  essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind;  he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.    `Well, what do you want of me?' said he, at last, with an effort.    `See here,' replied Fix; `I have tracked Mr Fogg to this place, but  as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent  to London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong--'    `I! But I--'    `I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the  Bank of England.'    `Never!' replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back, exhausted  in mind and body.    `Mr Fix,' he stammered; `even should what you say be true - if my master  is really the robber you are seeking for - which I deny - I have been,  am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will  never betray him - not for all the gold in the world. I come from a village  where they don't eat that kind of bread!'    `You refuse?'    `I refuse.'    `Consider that I've said nothing,' said Fix; `and let us drink.'    `Yes; let us drink!'    Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the  liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his  master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon  the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand. He took it put it  between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy  under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.    `At last!' said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. `Mr Fogg will  not be informed of the ""Carnatic's"" departure; and, if he is, he will have  to go without this cursed Frenchman!'    And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.        "
697,The Bible In Spain,99,George Borrow,Chapter15,"THE DEVOTED FRIEND                One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had    bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a    long bit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming    about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and    their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to    teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.        ""You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your    heads,"" she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed    them how it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to    her.  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage    it is to be in society at all.        ""What disobedient children!"" cried the old Water-rat; ""they really    deserve to be drowned.""        ""Nothing of the kind,"" answered the Duck, ""every one must make a    beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.""        ""Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,"" said the Water-    rat; ""I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married,    and I never intend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but    friendship is much higher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world    that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.""        ""And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?""    asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and    had overheard the conversation.        ""Yes, that is just what I want to know,"" said the Duck; and she    swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order    to give her children a good example.        ""What a silly question!"" cried the Water-rat.  ""I should expect my    devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.""        ""And what would you do in return?"" said the little bird, swinging    upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.        ""I don't understand you,"" answered the Water-rat.        ""Let me tell you a story on the subject,"" said the Linnet.        ""Is the story about me?"" asked the Water-rat.  ""If so, I will    listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.""        ""It is applicable to you,"" answered the Linnet; and he flew down,    and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted    Friend.        ""Once upon a time,"" said the Linnet, ""there was an honest little    fellow named Hans.""        ""Was he very distinguished?"" asked the Water-rat.        ""No,"" answered the Linnet, ""I don't think he was distinguished at    all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured    face.  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he    worked in his garden.  In all the country-side there was no garden    so lovely as his.  Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and    Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.  There were damask    Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets    and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the    Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink    bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by,    one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always    beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.        ""Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend    of all was big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich    Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without    leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of    sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it    was the fruit season.        ""'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used    to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of    having a friend with such noble ideas.        ""Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich    Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a    hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows,    and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head    about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to    listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the    unselfishness of true friendship.        ""So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the    summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came,    and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered    a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed    without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the    winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to    see him then.        ""'There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the    snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people    are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by    visitors.  That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure    I am right.  So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I    shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large    basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'        ""'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the    Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood    fire; 'very thoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you    talk about friendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not    say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a    three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.'        ""'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's    youngest son.  'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my    porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'        ""'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller; 'I really don't know    what is the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn    anything.  Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire,    and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get    envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil    anybody's nature.  I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be    spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him,    and see that he is not led into any temptations.  Besides, if Hans    came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit,    and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and friendship is    another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words are spelt    differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can see    that.'        ""'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a    large glass of warm ale; 'really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just    like being in church.'        ""'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller; 'but very few    people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more    difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also'; and he    looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so    ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite    scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.  However, he was so young    that you must excuse him.""        ""Is that the end of the story?"" asked the Water-rat.        ""Certainly not,"" answered the Linnet, ""that is the beginning.""        ""Then you are quite behind the age,"" said the Water-rat.  ""Every    good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to    the beginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new    method.  I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was    walking round the pond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at    great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had    blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made    any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'  But pray go on with your    story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all kinds of beautiful    sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.""        ""Well,"" said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the    other, ""as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to    open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he    would go down and see little Hans.        ""'Why, what a good heart you have'! cried his Wife; 'you are always    thinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for    the flowers.'        ""So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a    strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his    arm.        ""'Good morning, little Hans,' said the Miller.        ""'Good morning,' said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from    ear to ear.        ""'And how have you been all the winter?' said the Miller.        ""'Well, really,' cried Hans, 'it is very good of you to ask, very    good indeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now    the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are    doing well.'        ""'We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,' said the Miller,    'and wondered how you were getting on.'        ""'That was kind of you,' said Hans; 'I was half afraid you had    forgotten me.'        ""'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller; 'friendship never    forgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you    don't understand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are    looking, by-the-bye""!        ""'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most    lucky thing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them    into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and    buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'        ""'Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don't mean to say you have sold    it?  What a very stupid thing to do'!        ""'Well, the fact is,' said Hans, 'that I was obliged to.  You see    the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at    all to buy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my    Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my    big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy    them all back again now.'        ""'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is    not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is    something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will    give it to you.  I know it is very generous of me, and a great many    people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I    am not like the rest of the world.  I think that generosity is the    essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow    for myself.  Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my    wheelbarrow.'        ""'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his    funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.  'I can easily put    it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'        ""'A plank of wood'! said the Miller; 'why, that is just what I want    for the roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the    corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up.  How lucky you    mentioned it!  It is quite remarkable how one good action always    breeds another.  I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are    going to give me your plank.  Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth    far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things    like that.  Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn    this very day.'        ""'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and    dragged the plank out.        ""'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and    I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be    any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that    is not my fault.  And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am    sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.  Here is the    basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'        ""'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was    really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would    have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get    his silver buttons back.        ""'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my    wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few    flowers.  I may be wrong, but I should have thought that    friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any    kind.'        ""'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are    welcome to all the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have    your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day'; and he ran and    plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.        ""'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill    with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.        ""'Good-bye,' said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite    merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.        ""The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch,    when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road.  So    he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over    the wall.        ""There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.        ""'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this    sack of flour for me to market?'        ""'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.    I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water,    and all my grass to roll.'        ""'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I    am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you    to refuse.'        ""'Oh, don't say that,' cried little Hans, 'I wouldn't be unfriendly    for the whole world'; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off    with the big sack on his shoulders.        ""It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before    Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to    sit down and rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he    reached the market.  After he had waited there some time, he sold    the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home    at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might    meet some robbers on the way.        ""'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as    he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller,    for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his    wheelbarrow.'        ""Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for    his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still    in bed.        ""'Upon my word,' said the Miller, 'you are very lazy.  Really,    considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you    might work harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't    like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind    my speaking quite plainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of    doing so if I were not your friend.  But what is the good of    friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  Anybody can    say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true    friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving    pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he    knows that then he is doing good.'        ""'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling    off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie    in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you    know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?'        ""'Well, I am glad of that,' said the Miller, clapping little Hans    on the back, 'for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you    are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.'        ""Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden,    for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not    like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.        ""'Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?'    he inquired in a shy and timid voice.        ""'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'I do not think it is much to    ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow;    but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.'        ""'Oh! on no account,' cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed,    and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.        ""He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the    Miller came to see how he was getting on.        ""'Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?' cried the    Miller in a cheery voice.        ""'It is quite mended,' answered little Hans, coming down the    ladder.        ""'Ah'! said the Miller, 'there is no work so delightful as the work    one does for others.'        ""'It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,' answered    little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, 'a very great    privilege.  But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas    as you have.'        ""'Oh! they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take    more pains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship;    some day you will have the theory also.'        ""'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.        ""'I have no doubt of it,' answered the Miller, 'but now that you    have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want    you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.'        ""Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the    next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and    Hans started off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole    day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired    that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it    was broad daylight.        ""'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and    he went to work at once.        ""But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all,    for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him    off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little    Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his    flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself    by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.  'Besides,'    he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that    is an act of pure generosity.'        ""So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all    kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in    a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good    scholar.        ""Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his    fireside when a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild    night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so    terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.  But a    second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.        ""'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he    ran to the door.        ""There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick    in the other.        ""'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.  My    little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going    for the Doctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad    night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better    if you went instead of me.  You know I am going to give you my    wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something    for me in return.'        ""'Certainly,' cried little Hans, 'I take it quite as a compliment    your coming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend    me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might    fall into the ditch.'        ""'I am very sorry,' answered the Miller, 'but it is my new lantern,    and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.'        ""'Well, never mind, I will do without it,' cried little Hans, and    he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied    a muffler round his throat, and started off.        ""What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little    Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could    scarcely stand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had    been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor's house,    and knocked at the door.        ""'Who is there?' cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his    bedroom window.        ""'Little Hans, Doctor.'        ""'What do you want, little Hans?'        ""'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself,    and the Miller wants you to come at once.'        ""'All right!' said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his    big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in    the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind    him.        ""But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents,    and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with    the horse.  At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor,    which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and    there poor little Hans was drowned.  His body was found the next    day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was    brought back by them to the cottage.        ""Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and    the Miller was the chief mourner.        ""'As I was his best friend,' said the Miller, 'it is only fair that    I should have the best place'; so he walked at the head of the    procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped    his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.        ""'Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,' said the    Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated    comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet    cakes.        ""'A great loss to me at any rate,' answered the Miller; 'why, I had    as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't know    what to do with it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is    in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold    it.  I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.    One always suffers for being generous.'""        ""Well?"" said the Water-rat, after a long pause.        ""Well, that is the end,"" said the Linnet.        ""But what became of the Miller?"" asked the Water-rat.        ""Oh!  I really don't know,"" replied the Linnet; ""and I am sure that    I don't care.""        ""It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your    nature,"" said the Water-rat.        ""I am afraid you don't quite see the moral of the story,"" remarked    the Linnet.        ""The what?"" screamed the Water-rat.        ""The moral.""        ""Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?""        ""Certainly,"" said the Linnet.        ""Well, really,"" said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, ""I    think you should have told me that before you began.  If you had    done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I    should have said 'Pooh,' like the critic.  However, I can say it    now""; so he shouted out ""Pooh"" at the top of his voice, gave a    whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.        ""And how do you like the Water-rat?"" asked the Duck, who came    paddling up some minutes afterwards.  ""He has a great many good    points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can    never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my    eyes.""        ""I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,"" answered the Linnet.    ""The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.""        ""Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,"" said the Duck.        And I quite agree with her.      "
703,The Blue Fairy Book,16,Andrew Lang,15-felicia,"CHAPTER VIII      WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS    LADY DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO          ""BLESSED be Allah the all-powerful!"" says Hamete Benengeli on    beginning this eighth chapter; ""blessed be Allah!"" he repeats three    times; and he says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has    now got Don Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers    of his delightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours    of Don Quixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges    them to forget the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to    fix their eyes on those that are to come, which now begin on the    road to El Toboso, as the others began on the plains of Montiel; nor    is it much that he asks in consideration of all he promises, and so he    goes on to say:      Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took    his departure, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by    both knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy    omen; though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of    Dapple were louder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho    inferred that his good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his    master, building, perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may    have known, though the history says nothing about it; all that can    be said is, that when he stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he    wished he had not come out, for by stumbling or falling there was    nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or a broken rib; and, fool as    he was, he was not much astray in this.      Said Don Quixote, ""Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as    we go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by    daylight; for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another    adventure, and there I shall obtain the blessing and generous    permission of the peerless Dulcinea, with which permission I expect    and feel assured that I shall conclude and bring to a happy    termination every perilous adventure; for nothing in life makes    knights-errant more valorous than finding themselves favoured by their    ladies.""      ""So I believe,"" replied Sancho; ""but I think it will be difficult    for your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you    will be able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it    over the wall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took    her the letter that told of the follies and mad things your worship    was doing in the heart of Sierra Morena.""      ""Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,"" said Don Quixote,    ""where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled    grace and beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or    portico of some rich and royal palace.""      ""It might have been all that,"" returned Sancho, ""but to me it looked    like a wall, unless I am short of memory.""      ""At all events, let us go there, Sancho,"" said Don Quixote; ""for, so    that I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or    at a window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden;    for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give    light to my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be    unmatched and unequalled in wisdom and valour.""      ""Well, to tell the truth, senor,"" said Sancho, ""when I saw that    sun of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw    out beams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting    that wheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her    face like a cloud and dimmed it.""      ""What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,"" said Don Quixote, ""in    saying, thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was    sifting wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at    variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of    distinction, who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and    pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O    Sancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in their    crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from    their loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to    embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to    us, how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls;    and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady    when thou sawest her, only that the spite which some wicked    enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all those    things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike    their own; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which    they say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is    an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another, mingling a    thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating    transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true    history. O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the    virtues! All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them;    but envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.""      ""So I say too,"" replied Sancho; ""and I suspect in that legend or    history of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw, my    honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down,    sweeping the streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an    honest man, I never spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well    off that I am to be envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have    a certain spice of the rogue in me; but all is covered by the great    cloak of my simplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had    no other merit save that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly    in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and    that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have    mercy on me and treat me well in their writings. But let them say what    they like; naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor    gain; nay, while I see myself put into a book and passed on from    hand to hand over the world, I don't care a fig, let them say what    they like of me.""      ""That, Sancho,"" returned Don Quixote, ""reminds me of what happened    to a famous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire    against all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a    certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.    She, seeing she was not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had    seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others,    telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part,    or else look out for the consequences. The poet did as she bade him,    and left her without a shred of reputation, and she was satisfied by    getting fame though it was infamy. In keeping with this is what they    relate of that shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by    repute one of the seven wonders of the world, and burned it with the    sole object of making his name live in after ages; and, though it    was forbidden to name him, or mention his name by word of mouth or    in writing, lest the object of his ambition should be attained,    nevertheless it became known that he was called Erostratus. And    something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great    emperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome. The emperor was anxious    to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient times    the temple 'of all the gods,' but now-a-days, by a better    nomenclature, 'of all the saints,' which is the best preserved    building of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one which    best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its    founders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous    dimensions, and well lighted, though no light penetrates it save    that which is admitted by a window, or rather round skylight, at the    top; and it was from this that the emperor examined the building. A    Roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the skilful    construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful    architecture, and when they had left the skylight he said to the    emperor, 'A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon    me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from    yonder skylight, so as to leave behind me in the world a name that    would last for ever.' 'I am thankful to you for not carrying such an    evil thought into effect,' said the emperor, 'and I shall give you    no opportunity in future of again putting your loyalty to the test;    and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where I am;    and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him.    My meaning is, Sancho, that the desire of acquiring fame is a very    powerful motive. What, thinkest thou, was it that flung Horatius in    full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber? What    burned the hand and arm of Mutius? What impelled Curtius to plunge    into the deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome? What,    in opposition to all the omens that declared against him, made    Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern    examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and cut off the    gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous Cortes in    the New World? All these and a variety of other great exploits are,    were and will be, the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and    a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve; though we    Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to that future    glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to    the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present    transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after all    end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, O    Sancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the    Christian religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay    pride in giants, envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by    calmness of demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the    spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils, lust and    lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the    mistresses of our thoughts, indolence by traversing the world in all    directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves, besides    Christians, famous knights. Such, Sancho, are the means by which we    reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.""      ""All that your worship has said so far,"" said Sancho, ""I have    understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would    dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my    mind.""      ""Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,"" said Don Quixote; ""say on, in God's    name, and I will answer as well as I can.""      ""Tell me, senor,"" Sancho went on to say, ""those Julys or Augusts,    and all those venturous knights that you say are now dead- where are    they now?""      ""The heathens,"" replied Don Quixote, ""are, no doubt, in hell; the    Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or    in heaven.""      ""Very good,"" said Sancho; ""but now I want to know- the tombs where    the bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before    them, or are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,    winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are    they ornamented with?""      To which Don Quixote made answer: ""The tombs of the heathens were    generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Caesar's body were    placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call    in Rome Saint Peter's needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a    castle as large as a good-sized village, which they called the Moles    Adriani, and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen    Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one    of the seven wonders of the world; but none of these tombs, or of    the many others of the heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets    or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are    buried there are saints.""      ""That's the point I'm coming to,"" said Sancho; ""and now tell me,    which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a    giant?""      ""The answer is easy,"" replied Don Quixote; ""it is a greater work    to bring to life a dead man.""      ""Now I have got you,"" said Sancho; ""in that case the fame of them    who bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure    cripples, restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are    lamps burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on    their knees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and    in the other than that which all the heathen emperors and    knights-errant that have ever been in the world have left or may leave    behind them?""      ""That I grant, too,"" said Don Quixote.      ""Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you    call it,"" said Sancho, ""belong to the bodies and relics of the    saints who, with the approbation and permission of our holy mother    Church, have lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes    and legs, by means of which they increase devotion and add to their    own Christian reputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints    on their shoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn    their oratories and favourite altars with them.""      ""What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?""    asked Don Quixote.      ""My meaning is,"" said Sancho, ""let us set about becoming saints, and    we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after;    for you know, senor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it    is so lately one may say so) they canonised and beatified two little    barefoot friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss    or touch the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their    bodies, and they are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than    the sword of Roland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God    preserve. So that, senor, it is better to be an humble little friar of    no matter what order, than a valiant knight-errant; with God a    couple of dozen of penance lashings are of more avail than two    thousand lance-thrusts, be they given to giants, or monsters, or    dragons.""      ""All that is true,"" returned Don Quixote, ""but we cannot all be    friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven;    chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.""      ""Yes,"" said Sancho, ""but I have heard say that there are more friars    in heaven than knights-errant.""      ""That,"" said Don Quixote, ""is because those in religious orders    are more numerous than knights.""      ""The errants are many,"" said Sancho.      ""Many,"" replied Don Quixote, ""but few they who deserve the name of    knights.""      With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that    night and the following day, without anything worth mention    happening to them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected;    but at length the next day, at daybreak, they descried the great    city of El Toboso, at the sight of which Don Quixote's spirits rose    and Sancho's fell, for he did not know Dulcinea's house, nor in all    his life had he ever seen her, any more than his master; so that    they were both uneasy, the one to see her, the other at not having    seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what he was to do when    his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don Quixote made up    his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited until the    time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and when    the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance into    the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called    something.

739,The Decameron,107,Giovanni Boccaccio ,Day07,"chapter44            CHAPTER XLIV MOLLY GIBSON TO THE RESCUE       It seemed curious enough, after the storms of the night, to meet in  smooth tranquillity at breakfast. Cynthia was pale; but she talked as quietly  as usual about all manner of indifferent things, while Molly sate silent,  watching and wondering, and becoming convinced that Cynthia must have gone  through a long experience of concealing her real thoughts and secret troubles  before she could have been able to put on such a semblance of composure.  Among the letters that came in that morning was one from the London Kirkpatricks;  but not from Helen, Cynthia's own particular correspondent. Her sister  wrote to apologize for Helen, who was not well, she said: had had the influenza,  which had left her very weak and poorly.    'Let her come down here for change of air,' said Mr Gibson. 'The country  at this time of the year is better than London, excepting when the place  is surrounded by trees. Now our house is well drained, high up, gravel  soil, and I'll undertake to doctor her for nothing.'    'It would be charming,' said Mrs Gibson, rapidly revolving in her mind  the changes necessary in her household economy before receiving a young  lady accustomed to such a household as Mr Kirkpatrick's, and calculating  the consequent inconveniences in her own mind, weighing them against the  probable advantages even while she spoke.    'Should not you like it, Cynthia? and Molly too. You too, dear, would  become acquainted with one of the girls, and I have no doubt you would  be asked back again, which would be so very nice!'    'And I should not let her go,' said Mr Gibson, who had acquired an unfortunate  facility of reading his wife's thoughts.    'Dear Helen!' went on Mrs Gibson, 'I should so like to nurse her, we  would make your consulting-room into her own private sitting-room, my dear.'  - (It is hardly necessary to say that the scales had been weighed down  by the inconveniences of having a person behind the scenes for several  weeks). 'For with an invalid so much depends on tranquillity. In the drawing-room,  for instance, she might constantly be disturbed by callers; and the dining-room  is so - so what shall I call it? so dinnery, - the smell of meals never  seems to leave it; it would have been different if dear papa had allowed  me to throw out that window -- '    'Why can't she have the dressing-room for her bed-room, and the little  room opening out of the drawing-room for her sitting-room?' asked Mr Gibson.    'The library,' for by this name Mrs Gibson chose to dignify what had  formerly been called the book-closet, - 'why, it would hardly hold a sofa,  besides the books and the writing-table, and there are draughts everywhere.  No, my dear, we had better not ask her at all, her own home is comfortable  at any rate!'    'Well, well!' said Mr Gibson, seeing that he was to be worsted, and  not caring enough about the matter to show fight. 'Perhaps you are right.  It's a case of luxury versus fresh air. Some people suffer more from the  want of one than from want of the other. You know I shall be glad to see  her if she likes to come, and take us as we are, but I can't give up the  consulting-room. It's a necessity; our daily bread!'    'I'll write and tell them how kind Mr Gibson is,' said his wife in high  contentment, as her husband left the room. 'They'll be just as much obliged  to him as if she had come!'    Whether it was Helen's illness, or from some other cause, after breakfast  Cynthia became very flat and absent, and this lasted all day long; Molly  understood now why her moods had been so changeable for many months, and  was tender and forbearing with her accordingly. Towards evening when the  two girls were left alone, Cynthia came and stood over Molly, so that her  face could not be seen.    'Molly,' said she, 'will you do it? Will you do what you said last night?  I have been thinking of it all day, and sometimes I believe he would give  you back the letters if you asked him; he might fancy - at any rate it's  worth trying, if you don't very much dislike it.'    Now it so happened that with every thought she had given to it, Molly  disliked the idea of the proposed interview with Mr !Preston more and more;  but it was after all her own offer, and she neither could nor would draw  back from it; it might do good; she did not see how it could possibly do  harm. So she gave her consent, and tried to conceal her distaste, which  grew upon her more and more as Cynthia hastily arranged the details.    'You shall meet him in the avenue leading from the park lodge up to  the Towers. He can come in one way, from the Towers, where he has often  business - he has pass-keys everywhere - you can go in as we have often  done by the lodge - you need not go far.'    It did strike Molly that Cynthia must have had some experience in making  all these arrangements; and she did venture to ask how he was to be informed  of all this? Cynthia only reddened, and replied, 'Oh! never mind! He will  only be too glad to come; you heard him say he wished to discuss the affair  more; it is the first time the appointment has come from my side. If I  can but once be free - oh, Molly, I will love you, and be grateful to you  all my life!'    Molly thought of Roger, and that thought prompted her next speech.    'It must be horrible - I think I'm very brave - but I don't think I  could have - could have accepted even Roger, with a half-cancelled engagement  hanging over me.' She blushed as she spoke.    'You forget how I detest Mr Preston!' said Cynthia. 'It was that, more  than any excess of love for Roger, that made me thankful to be at least  as securely pledged to some one else. He did not want to call it an engagement,  but I did; because it gave me the feeling of assurance that I was free  from Mr Preston. And so I am! all but these letters. Oh! if you can but  make him take back his abominable money, and get me my letters. Then we  would bury it all in oblivion, and he could marry somebody else, and I  would marry Roger, and no one would be the wiser. After all it was only  what people call ""youthful folly."" And you may tell Mr Preston that as  soon as he makes my letters public, shows them to your father or anything,  I'll go away from Hollingford, and never come back -- '    Loaded with many such messages, which she felt that she should never  deliver, not really knowing what she should say, hating the errand, not  satisfied with Cynthia's manner of speaking about her relations to Roger,  oppressed with shame and complicity in conduct which appeared to her deceitful,  yet willing to bear all and brave all, if she could once set Cynthia in  a straight path - in a clear space, and almost more pitiful to her friend's  great distress and possible disgrace, than able to give her that love which  involves perfect sympathy, Molly set out on her walk towards the appointed  place. It was a cloudy blustering day, and the noise of the blowing wind  among the nearly leafless branches of the great trees filled her ears,  as she passed through the park-gates and entered the avenue. She walked  quickly, instinctively wishing to get her blood up, and have no time for  thought. But there was a bend in the avenue about a quarter of a mile from  the lodge; after that bend it was a straight line up to the great house,  now emptied of its inhabitants. Molly did not like going quite out of sight  of the lodge, and she stood facing it, close by the trunk of one of the  trees. Presently she heard a step coming over the grass. It was Mr Preston.  He saw a woman's figure, half-behind the trunk of a tree, and made no doubt  that it was Cynthia. But when he came nearer, almost close, the figure  turned round, and, instead of the brilliantly coloured face of Cynthia,  he met the pale resolved look of Molly. She did not speak to greet him,  but though he felt sure from the general aspect of pallor and timidity  that she was afraid of him, her steady grey eyes met his with courageous  innocence.    'Is Cynthia unable to come?' asked he, perceiving that she expected  him.    'I did not know you thought that you should meet her,' said Molly, a  little surprised. In her simplicity she had believed that Cynthia had named  that it was she, Molly Gibson, who would meet Mr Preston at a given time  and place; but Cynthia had been too worldly-wise for that, and had decoyed  him thither by a vaguely worded note, which, while avoiding actual falsehood,  had led him to believe that she herself would give him the meeting.    'She said she should be here,' said Mr Preston, extremely annoyed at  being entrapped as he now felt that he had been, into an interview with  Miss Gibson. Molly hesitated a little before she spoke. He was determined  not to break the silence; as she had intruded herself into the affair,  she should find her situation as awkward as possible.    'At any rate she sent me here to meet you,' said Molly. 'She has told  me exactly how matters stand between you and her.'    'Has she?' sneered he. 'She is not always the most open or reliable  person in the world!'    Molly reddened. She perceived the impertinence of the tone; and her  temper was none of the coolest. But she mastered herself and gained courage  by so doing.    'You should not speak so of the person you profess to wish to have for  your wife. But putting all that aside, you have some letters of hers that  she wishes to have back again.'    'I dare say.'    'And that you have no right to keep.'    'No legal, or no moral right? which do you mean?'    'I do not know; simply you have no right at all, as a gentleman, to  keep a girl's letters when she asks for them back again, much less to hold  them over her as a threat.'    'I see you do know all, Miss Gibson,' said he, changing his manner to  one of more respect. 'At least she has told you her story from her point  of view, her side; now you must hear mine. She promised me as solemnly  as ever woman -- '    'She was not a woman, she was only a girl, barely sixteen.'    'Old enough to know what she was doing; but I'll call her a girl if  you like. She promised me solemnly to be my wife, making the one stipulation  of secrecy, and a certain period of waiting; she wrote me letters repeating  this promise, and confidential enough to prove that she considered herself  bound to me by such an implied relation. I don't give in to humbug - I  don't set myself up as a saint - and in most ways I can look after my own  interests pretty keenly; you know enough of her position as a penniless  girl, and at that time, with no influential connections to take the place  of wealth, and help me on in the world, it was as sincere and unworldly  a passion as ever man felt; she must say so herself. I might have married  two or three girls with plenty of money; one of them was handsome enough,  and not at all reluctant.'    Molly interrupted him; she was chafed at the conceit of his manner.  'I beg your pardon, but I do not want to hear accounts of young ladies  whom you might have married; I come here simply on behalf of Cynthia, who  does not like you, and who does not wish to marry you.'    'Well, then I must make her ""like"" me, as you call it. She did ""like""  me once, and made promises which she will find it requires the consent  of two people to break. I don't despair of making her love me as much as  ever she did, according to her letters, at least, when we are married.'    'She will never marry you,' said Molly, firmly.    'Then if she ever honours any one else with her preference, he shall  be allowed the perusal of her letters to me.'    Molly almost could have laughed; she was so secure and certain that  Roger would never read letters offered to him under these circumstances;  but then she thought that he would feel such pain at the whole affair,  and at the contact with Mr Preston, especially if he had not heard of it  from Cynthia first, and if she, Molly, could save him pain she would. Before  she could settle what to say, Mr Preston spoke again.    'You said the other day that Cynthia was engaged. May I ask whom to?'    'No,' said Molly, 'you may not. You heard her say it was not an engagement.  It is not exactly; and if it were a full engagement, do you think, after  what you last said, I should tell you to whom? But you may be sure of this,  he would never read a line of your letters. He is too - No! I won't speak  of him before you. You could never understand him.'    'It seems to me that this mysterious ""he"" is a very fortunate person  to have such a warm defender in Miss Gibson, to whom he is not at all engaged,'  said Mr Preston, with so disagreeable a look on his face that Molly suddenly  found herself on the point of bursting into tears. But she rallied herself,  and worked on - for Cynthia first, and for Roger as well.    'No honourable man or woman will read your letters, and if any people  do read them, they will be so much ashamed of it that they won't dare to  speak of them. What use can they be of to you?'    'They contain Cynthia's reiterated promises of marriage,' replied he.    'She says she would rather leave Hollingford for ever, and go out to  earn her bread, than marry you.'    His face fell a little. He looked so bitterly mortified that Molly was  almost sorry for him.    'Does she say that to you in cold blood? Do you know you are telling  me very hard truths, Miss Gibson? - if they are truths, that is to say,'  he continued, recovering himself a little. 'Young ladies are very fond  of the words ""hate"" and ""detest."" I have known many who have applied them  to men whom they were all the time hoping to marry.'    'I cannot tell about other people,' said Molly, 'I only know that Cynthia  does - ' Here she hesitated for a moment; she fell for his pain, and so  she hesitated; but then she brought it out, - 'does as nearly hate you  as anybody like her ever does hate.'    'Like her?' said he, repeating the words almost unconsciously, seizing  on anything to try and hide his mortification.    'I mean, I should hate worse,' said Molly in a low voice.    But he did not attend much to her answer. He was working the point of  his stick into the turf, and his eyes were bent on it.    'So now would you mind sending her back the letters by me? I do assure  you that you cannot make her marry you.'    'You are very simple, Miss Gibson,' said he, suddenly lifting up his  head. 'I suppose that you don't know that there is any other feeling that  can be gratified, excepting love. Have you never heard of revenge? Cynthia  had cajoled me with promises, and little as you or she may believe me -  well, it's of no use speaking of that. I don't mean to let her go unpunished.  You may tell her that. I shall keep the letters, and make use of them as  I see fit when the occasion arises.'    Molly was miserably angry with herself for her mismanagement of the  affair. She had hoped to succeed: she had only made matters worse. What  new argument could she use? Meanwhile he went on, lashing himself up as  he thought how the two girls must have talked him over, bringing in wounded  vanity to add to the rage of disappointed love.    'Mr Osborne Hamley may hear of their contents, though he may be too  honourable to read them. Nay, even your father may hear whispers; and if  I remember them rightly, Miss Cynthia Kirkpatrick does not always speak  in the most respectful terms of the lady who is now Mrs Gibson. There are  -- '    'Stop,' said Molly. 'I won't hear anything out of these letters, written,  when she was almost without friends, to you whom she looked upon as a friend!  But I have thought of what I will do next. I give you fair warning. If  I had not been foolish I should have told my father, but Cynthia made me  promise that I would not. So I will tell it all, from beginning to end,  to Lady Harriet, and ask her to speak to her father. I feel sure that she  will do it; and I don't think you will dare to refuse Lord Cumnor.'    He felt at once that he should not dare; that, clever land-agent as  he was, and high up in the earl's favour on that account, yet that the  conduct of which he had been guilty about these letters, and the threats  which he had held out about them, were just what no gentleman, no honourable  man, no manly man, could put up with in any one about him. He knew that  much, and he wondered how she, the girl standing before him, had been clever  enough to find it out. He forgot himself for an instant in admiration of  her. There she stood, frightened, yet brave, not letting go her hold on  what she meant to do, even when things seemed most against her; and besides,  there was something that struck him most of all perhaps, and which shows  the kind of man he was - he perceived that Molly was as unconscious that  he was a young man, and she a young woman, as if she had been a pure angel  of heaven. Though he felt that he would have to yield, and give up the  letters, he was not going to do it at once; and while he was thinking what  to say so as still to evade making any concession till he had had time  to think over it, he, with his quick senses all about him, heard the trotting  of a horse cranching quickly along over the gravel of the drive. A moment  afterwards, Molly's perception overtook his. He could see the startled  look overspread her face; and in an instant she would have run away, but  before the first rush was made, Mr Preston laid his hand firmly on her  arm.    'Keep quiet. You must be seen. You, at any rate, have done nothing to  be ashamed of.'    As he spoke Mr Sheepshanks came round the bend of the road and was close  upon them. Mr Preston saw, if Molly did not, the sudden look of intelligence  that dawned upon the shrewd ruddy face of the old gentleman - saw, but  did not much heed. He went forwards and spoke to Mr Sheepshanks, who made  a halt right before them.    'Miss Gibson! your servant! Rather a blustering day for a young lady  to be out, and cold, I should say, for standing still too long; eh, Preston?'  poking his whip at the latter in a knowing manner.    'Yes,' said Mr Preston; 'and I'm afraid I have kept Miss Gibson too  long standing.'    Molly did not know what to say or do; so she only bowed a silent farewell,  and turned away to go home, feeling very heavy at heart at the non-success  of her undertaking. For she did not know how she had conquered, in fact,  although Mr Preston might not as yet acknowledge it even to himself. Before  she was out of hearing, she heard Mr Sheepshanks say, -    'Sorry to have disturbed your tête-?tête, Preston,' but  though she heard the words, their implied sense did not sink into her mind;  she was only feeling how she had gone out glorious and confident, and was  coming back to Cynthia defeated. Pr    Cynthia was on the watch for her return, and, rushing downstairs, dragged  Molly into the dining-room.    'Well, Molly? Oh! I see you have not got them. After all, I never expected  it.' She sate down, as if she could get over her disappointment better  in that position, and Molly stood like a guilty person before her.    'I am so sorry; I did all I could; we were interrupted at last - Mr  Sheepshanks rode up.'    'Provoking old man! Do you think you should have persuaded him to give  up the letters if you had had more time?'    'I don't know. I wish Mr Sheepshanks had not come just then. I did not  like his finding me standing talking to Mr Preston.'    'Oh! I daresay he would never think anything about it. What did he -  Mr Preston - say?'    'He seemed to think you were fully engaged to him, and that these letters  were the only proof he had. I think he loves you in his way.'    'His way, indeed!' said Cynthia, scornfully.    'The more I think of it, the more I see it would be better for papa  to speak to him. I did say I would tell it all to Lady Harriet, and get  Lord Cumnor to make him give up the letters. But it would be very awkward.'    'Very!' said Cynthia, gloomily. 'But he would see it was only a threat.'    'But I will do it in a moment, if you like. I meant what I said; only  I feel that papa would manage it best of all, and more privately.'    'I'll tell you what, Molly; you're bound by a promise, you know, and  cannot tell Mr Gibson without breaking your solemn word; but it's just  this. I'll leave Hollingford and never come back again, if ever your father  hears of this affair; there!' Cynthia stood up now, and began to fold up  Molly's shawl, in her nervous excitement.    'Oh, Cynthia - Roger!' was all that Molly said.    'Yes, I know! you need not remind me of him. But I'm not going to live  in the house with any one who may be always casting up in his mind the  things he had heard against me - things - faults, perhaps - which sound  so much worse than they really are. I was so happy when I first came here:  you all liked me, and admired me, and thought well of me, and now -- Why,  Molly, I can see the difference in you already. You carry your thoughts  in your face - I have read them there these two days - you've been thinking,  ""How Cynthia must have deceived me; keeping up a correspondence all this  time - having half-engagements to two men."" You've been more full of that  than of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for  herself, without any friend to help her and protect her.'    Molly was silent. There was a great deal of truth in what Cynthia was  saying; and yet a great deal of falsehood. For, through all this long forty-eight  hours, Molly had loved Cynthia dearly; and had been more weighed down by  the position the latter was in than Cynthia herself. She also knew - but  this was a second thought following on the other - that she had suffered  much pain in trying to do her best in this interview with Mr Preston. She  had been tried beyond her strength; and the great tears welled up into  her eyes, and fell slowly down her cheeks.    'Oh! what a brute I am,' said Cynthia, kissing them away. 'I see - I  know it is the truth, and I deserve it - but I need not reproach you.'    'You did not reproach me!' said Molly, trying to smile. 'I have thought  some of what you said - but I do love you dearly - dearly, Cynthia - I  should have done just the same as you did.'    'No, you would not. Your grain is different, somehow.'        "
740,"The Descent Of Man, And Selection In Relation To Sex",41,Charles Darwin,Descent_chap3,"BOOK III        XVII            At dinner that evening Madame de Chantelle's slender    monologue was thrown out over gulfs of silence.  Owen was    still in the same state of moody abstraction as when Darrow    had left him at the piano; and even Anna's face, to her    friend's vigilant eye, revealed not, perhaps, a personal    preoccupation, but a vague sense of impending disturbance.        She smiled, she bore a part in the talk, her eyes dwelt on    Darrow's with their usual deep reliance; but beneath the    surface of her serenity his tense perceptions detected a    hidden stir.        He was sufficiently self-possessed to tell himself that it    was doubtless due to causes with which he was not directly    concerned.  He knew the question of Owen's marriage was soon    to be raised, and the abrupt alteration in the young man's    mood made it seem probable that he was himself the centre of    the atmospheric disturbance, For a moment it occurred to    Darrow that Anna might have employed her afternoon in    preparing Madame de Chantelle for her grandson's impending    announcement; but a glance at the elder lady's unclouded    brow showed that he must seek elsewhere the clue to Owen's    taciturnity and his step-mother's concern.  Possibly Anna    had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter,    and had made the change known to Owen.  But this, again, was    negatived by the fact that, during the afternoon's shooting,    young Leath had been in a mood of almost extravagant    expansiveness, and that, from the moment of his late return    to the house till just before dinner, there had been, to    Darrow's certain knowledge, no possibility of a private talk    between himself and his step-mother.        This obscured, if it narrowed, the field of conjecture; and    Darrow's gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he    was probably reading too much significance into the moods of    a lad he hardly knew, and who had been described to him as    subject to sudden changes of humour.  As to Anna's fancied    perturbation, it might simply be due to the fact that she    had decided to plead Owen's cause the next day, and had    perhaps already had a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting    her.  But Darrow knew that he was too deep in his own    perplexities to judge the mental state of those about him.    It might be, after all, that the variations he felt in the    currents of communication were caused by his own inward    tremor.        Such, at any rate, was the conclusion he had reached when,    shortly after the two ladies left the drawing-room, he bade    Owen good-night and went up to his room. Ever since the    rapid self-colloquy which had followed on his first sight of    Sophy Viner, he had known there were other questions to be    faced behind the one immediately confronting him.  On the    score of that one, at least, his mind, if not easy, was    relieved.  He had done what was possible to reassure the    girl, and she had apparently recognized the sincerity of his    intention.  He had patched up as decent a conclusion as he    could to an incident that should obviously have had no    sequel; but he had known all along that with the securing of    Miss Viner's peace of mind only a part of his obligation was    discharged, and that with that part his remaining duty was    in conflict.  It had been his first business to convince the    girl that their secret was safe with him; but it was far    from easy to square this with the equally urgent obligation    of safe-guarding Anna's responsibility toward her child.    Darrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures.  Both    he and Sophy Viner had too much at stake not to be on their    guard. The fear that beset him was of another kind, and had    a profounder source.  He wanted to do all he could for the    girl, but the fact of having had to urge Anna to confide    Effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him. His own ideas    about Sophy Viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him    not to feel the risk of such an experiment; yet he found    himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it    on the woman he desired above all others to protect...        Till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of    indecision.  His pride was humbled by the discrepancy    between what Sophy Viner had been to him and what he had    thought of her.  This discrepancy, which at the time had    seemed to simplify the incident, now turned out to be its    most galling complication.  The bare truth, indeed, was that    he had hardly thought of her at all, either at the time or    since, and that he was ashamed to base his judgement of her    on his meagre memory of their adventure.        The essential cheapness of the whole affair--as far as his    share in it was concerned--came home to him with humiliating    distinctness.  He would have liked to be able to feel that,    at the time at least, he had staked something more on it,    and had somehow, in the sequel, had a more palpable loss to    show.  But the plain fact was that he hadn't spent a penny    on it; which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score    it had since been rolling up.  At any rate, beat about the    case as he would, it was clear that he owed it to Anna--and    incidentally to his own peace of mind--to find some way of    securing Sophy Viner's future without leaving her installed    at Givre when he and his wife should depart for their new    post.        The night brought no aid to the solving of this problem; but    it gave him, at any rate, the clear conviction that no time    was to be lost.  His first step must be to obtain from Miss    Viner the chance of another and calmer talk; and he resolved    to seek it at the earliest hour.        He had gathered that Effie's lessons were preceded by an    early scamper in the park, and conjecturing that her    governess might be with her he betook himself the next    morning to the terrace, whence he wandered on to the gardens    and the walks beyond.        The atmosphere was still and pale.  The muffled sunlight    gleamed like gold tissue through grey gauze, and the beech    alleys tapered away to a blue haze blent of sky and forest.    It was one of those elusive days when the familiar forms of    things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic shimmer.        The stillness was presently broken by joyful barks, and    Darrow, tracking the sound, overtook Effie flying down one    of the long alleys at the head of her pack.  Beyond her he    saw Miss Viner seated near the stone-rimmed basin beside    which he and Anna had paused on their first walk to the    river.        The girl, coming forward at his approach, returned his    greeting almost gaily.  His first glance showed him that she    had regained her composure, and the change in her appearance    gave him the measure of her fears.  For the first time he    saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed his    eyes in Paris; but he saw it now as in a painted picture.        ""Shall we sit down a minute?"" he asked, as Effie trotted    off.        The girl looked away from him.  ""I'm afraid there's not much    time; we must be back at lessons at half-past nine.""        ""But it's barely ten minutes past.  Let's at least walk a    little way toward the river.""        She glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back    in the direction of the house.  ""If you like,"" she said in a    low voice, with one of her quick fluctuations of colour; but    instead of taking the way he proposed she turned toward a    narrow path which branched off obliquely through the trees.        Darrow was struck, and vaguely troubled, by the change in    her look and tone.  There was in them an undefinable appeal,    whether for help or forbearance he could not tell.  Then it    occurred to him that there might have been something    misleading in his so pointedly seeking her, and he felt a    momentary constraint.  To ease it he made an abrupt dash at    the truth.        ""I came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday    was so unsatisfactory.  I want to hear more about you--about    your plans and prospects.  I've been wondering ever since    why you've so completely given up the theatre.""        Her face instantly sharpened to distrust.  ""I had to live,""    she said in an off-hand tone.        ""I understand perfectly that you should like it here--for a    time.""  His glance strayed down the gold-roofed windings    ahead of them.  ""It's delightful: you couldn't be better    placed.  Only I wonder a little at your having so completely    given up any idea of a different future.""        She waited for a moment before answering: ""I suppose I'm    less restless than I used to be.""        ""It's certainly natural that you should be less restless    here than at Mrs. Murrett's; yet somehow I don't seem to see    you permanently given up to forming the young.""        ""What--exactly--DO you seem to see me permanently given    up to?  You know you warned me rather emphatically against    the theatre.""  She threw off the statement without    impatience, as though they were discussing together the fate    of a third person in whom both were benevolently interested.    Darrow considered his reply.  ""If I did, it was because you    so emphatically refused to let me help you to a start.""        She stopped short and faced him ""And you think I may let you    now?""        Darrow felt the blood in his cheek.  He could not understand    her attitude--if indeed she had consciously taken one, and    her changes of tone did not merely reflect the involuntary    alternations of her mood.  It humbled him to perceive once    more how little he had to guide him in his judgment of her.    He said to himself: ""If I'd ever cared a straw for her I    should know how to avoid hurting her now""--and his    insensibility struck him as no better than a vulgar    obtuseness.  But he had a fixed purpose ahead and could only    push on to it.        ""I hope, at any rate, you'll listen to my reasons. There's    been time, on both sides, to think them over since----"" He    caught himself back and hung helpless on the ""since"":    whatever words he chose, he seemed to stumble among    reminders of their past.        She walked on beside him, her eyes on the ground. ""Then I'm    to understand--definitely--that you DO renew your    offer?"" she asked        ""With all my heart!  If you'll only let me----""        She raised a hand, as though to check him.  ""It's extremely    friendly of you--I DO believe you mean it as a friend--    but I don't quite understand why, finding me, as you say, so    well placed here, you should show more anxiety about my    future than at a time when I was actually, and rather    desperately, adrift.""        ""Oh, no, not more!""        ""If you show any at all, it must, at any rate, be for    different reasons.--In fact, it can only be,"" she went on,    with one of her disconcerting flashes of astuteness, ""for    one of two reasons; either because you feel you ought to    help me, or because, for some reason, you think you owe it    to Mrs. Leath to let her know what you know of me.""        Darrow stood still in the path.  Behind him he heard Effie's    call, and at the child's voice he saw Sophy turn her head    with the alertness of one who is obscurely on the watch.    The look was so fugitive that he could not have said wherein    it differed from her normal professional air of having her    pupil on her mind.        Effie sprang past them, and Darrow took up the girl's    challenge.        ""What you suggest about Mrs. Leath is hardly worth    answering.  As to my reasons for wanting to help you, a good    deal depends on the words one uses to define rather    indefinite things.  It's true enough that I want to help    you; but the wish isn't due to...to any past kindness on    your part, but simply to my own interest in you.  Why not    put it that our friendship gives me the right to intervene    for what I believe to be your benefit?""        She took a few hesitating steps and then paused again.    Darrow noticed that she had grown pale and that there were    rings of shade about her eyes.        ""You've known Mrs. Leath a long time?"" she asked him    suddenly.        He paused with a sense of approaching peril.  ""A long time--    yes.""        ""She told me you were friends--great friends""        ""Yes,"" he admitted, ""we're great friends.""        ""Then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling    her that you don't think I'm the right person for Effie.""    He uttered a sound of protest, but she disregarded it.  ""I    don't say you'd LIKE to do it. You wouldn't: you'd hate    it.  And the natural alternative would be to try to persuade    me that I'd be better off somewhere else than here.  But    supposing that failed, and you saw I was determined to stay?    THEN you might think it your duty to tell Mrs. Leath.""        She laid the case before him with a cold lucidity.  ""I    should, in your place, I believe,"" she ended with a little    laugh.        ""I shouldn't feel justified in telling her, behind your    back, if I thought you unsuited for the place; but I should    certainly feel justified,"" he rejoined after a pause, ""in    telling YOU if I thought the place unsuited to you.""        ""And that's what you're trying to tell me now?""        ""Yes; but not for the reasons you imagine.""        ""What, then, are your reasons, if you please?""        ""I've already implied them in advising you not to give up    all idea of the theatre.  You're too various, too gifted,    too personal, to tie yourself down, at your age, to the    dismal drudgery of teaching.""        ""And is THAT what you've told Mrs. Leath?""        She rushed the question out at him as if she expected to    trip him up over it.  He was moved by the simplicity of the    stratagem.        ""I've told her exactly nothing,"" he replied.        ""And what--exactly--do you mean by 'nothing'?  You and she    were talking about me when I came into her sitting-room    yesterday.""        Darrow felt his blood rise at the thrust.        ""I've told her, simply, that I'd seen you once or twice at    Mrs. Murrett's.""        ""And not that you've ever seen me since?""        ""And not that I've ever seen you since...""        ""And she believes you--she completely believes you?""        He uttered a protesting exclamation, and his flush reflected    itself in the girl's cheek.        ""Oh, I beg your pardon!  I didn't mean to ask you that.""  She    halted, and again cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of    her.  Then she held out her hand.  ""Well, then, thank you--    and let me relieve your fears.  I sha'n't be Effie's    governess much longer.""        At the announcement, Darrow tried to merge his look of    relief into the expression of friendly interest with which    he grasped her hand.  ""You really do agree with me, then?    And you'll give me a chance to talk things over with you?""        She shook her head with a faint smile.  ""I'm not thinking of    the stage.  I've had another offer: that's all.""        The relief was hardly less great.  After all, his personal    responsibility ceased with her departure from Givre.        ""You'll tell me about that, then--won't you?""        Her smile flickered up.  ""Oh, you'll hear about it soon...I    must catch Effie now and drag her back to the blackboard.""        She walked on for a few yards, and then paused again and    confronted him.  ""I've been odious to you--and not quite    honest,"" she broke out suddenly.        ""Not quite honest?"" he repeated, caught in a fresh wave of    wonder.        ""I mean, in seeming not to trust you.  It's come over me    again as we talked that, at heart, I've always KNOWN I    could...""        Her colour rose in a bright wave, and her eyes clung to his    for a swift instant of reminder and appeal.  For the same    space of time the past surged up in him confusedly; then a    veil dropped between them.        ""Here's Effie now!"" she exclaimed.        He turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them, her    hand in Owen Leath's.    Even through the stir of his subsiding excitement Darrow was    at once aware of the change effected by the young man's    approach.  For a moment Sophy Viner's cheeks burned redder;    then they faded to the paleness of white petals.  She lost,    however, nothing of the bright bravery which it was her way    to turn on the unexpected.  Perhaps no one less familiar    with her face than Darrow would have discerned the tension    of the smile she transferred from himself to Owen Leath, or    have remarked that her eyes had hardened from misty grey to    a shining darkness.  But her observer was less struck by    this than by the corresponding change in Owen Leath.  The    latter, when he came in sight, had been laughing and talking    unconcernedly with Effie; but as his eye fell on Miss Viner    his expression altered as suddenly as hers.        The change, for Darrow, was less definable; but, perhaps for    that reason, it struck him as more sharply significant.    Only--just what did it signify?  Owen, like Sophy Viner, had    the kind of face which seems less the stage on which    emotions move than the very stuff they work in.  In moments    of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow    fluid, to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of    clouds on a stream.  Darrow, through the rapid flight of the    shadows, could not seize on any specific indication of    feeling: he merely perceived that the young man was    unaccountably surprised at finding him with Miss Viner, and    that the extent of his surprise might cover all manner of    implications.        Darrow's first idea was that Owen, if he suspected that the    conversation was not the result of an accidental encounter,    might wonder at his step-mother's suitor being engaged, at    such an hour, in private talk with her little girl's    governess.  The thought was so disturbing that, as the three    turned back to the house, he was on the point of saying to    Owen: ""I came out to look for your mother.""  But, in the    contingency he feared, even so simple a phrase might seem    like an awkward attempt at explanation; and he walked on in    silence at Miss Viner's side.  Presently he was struck by    the fact that Owen Leath and the girl were silent also; and    this gave a new turn to his thoughts. Silence may be as    variously shaded as speech; and that which enfolded Darrow    and his two companions seemed to his watchful perceptions to    be quivering with cross-threads of communication.  At first    he was aware only of those that centred in his own troubled    consciousness; then it occurred to him that an equal    activity of intercourse was going on outside of it.    Something was in fact passing mutely and rapidly between    young Leath and Sophy Viner; but what it was, and whither it    tended, Darrow, when they reached the house, was but just    beginning to divine...      "
751,The Economy Of Machinery And Manufactures,40,Charles Babbage  ,Index,"The Principles of Political Economy   by John Stuart Mill      Book 3, Distribution      Chapter 2      Of Demand and Supply in Their Relation to Value          1. That a thing may have any value in exchange, two   conditions are necessary. It must be of some use; that is (as   already explained) it must conduce to some purpose, satisfy some   desire. No one will pay a price, or part with anything which   serves some of his purposes, to obtain a thing which serves none   of them. But, secondly, the thing must not only have some   utility, there must also be some difficulty in its attainment.   ""Any article whatever,"" says Mr De Quincey,(1*) ""to obtain that   artificial sort of value which is meant by exchange value, must   begin by offering itself as a means to some desirable purpose;   and secondly, even though possessing incontestably this   preliminary advantage, it will never ascend to an exchange value   in cases where it can be obtained gratuitously and without   effort; of which last terms both are necessary as limitations.   For often it will happen that some desirable object may be   obtained gratuitously; stoop, and you gather it at your feet; but   still, because the continued iteration of this stooping exacts a   laborious effort, very soon it is found, that to gather for   yourself virtually is not gratuitous. In the vast forests of the   Canadas, at intervals, wild strawberries may be gratuitously   gathered by shiploads: yet such is the exhaustion of a stooping   posture, and of a labour so monotonous, that everybody is soon   glad to resign the service into mercenary hands.""       As was pointed out in the last chapter, the utility of a   thing in the estimation of the purchaser, is the extreme limit of   its exchange value: higher the value cannot ascend; peculiar   circumstances are required to raise it so high. This topic is   happily illustrated by Mr. De Quincey. ""Walk into almost any   possible shop, buy the first article you see; what will determine   its price? In the ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, simply the   element D -- difficulty of attainment. The other element U, or   intrinsic utility, will be perfectly inoperative. Let the thing   (measured by its uses) be, for your Purposes, worth ten guineas,   so that you would rather give ten guineas than lose it; yet, if   the difficulty of producing it be only worth one guinea, one   guinea is the price which it will bear. But still not the less,   though U is inoperative, can U be supposed absent? By no   possibility; for, if it had been absent, assuredly you would not   have bought the article even at the lowest price. U acts upon   you, though it does not act upon the price. On the other hand, in   the hundredth case, we will suppose the circumstances reversed:   you are on Lake Superior in a steam-boat, making your way to an   unsettled region 800 miles a-head of civilization, and   consciously with no chance at all of purchasing any luxury   whatsoever, little luxury or big luxury, for the space of ten   years to come. One fellow-passenger, whom you will part with   before sunset, has a powerful musical snuff-box; knowing by   experience the power of such a toy over your own feelings, the   magic with which at times it lulls your agitations of mind, you   are vehemently desirous to purchase it. In the hour of leaving   London you had forgot to do so; here is a final chance. But the   owner, aware of your situation not less than yourself, is   determined to operate by a strain pushed to the very uttermost   upon U, upon the intrinsic worth of the article in your   individual estimate for your individual purposes. He will not   hear of D as any controlling power or mitigating agency in the   case; and finally, although at six guineas a-piece in London or   Paris you might have loaded a waggon with such boxes, you pay   sixty rather than lose it when the last knell of the clock has   sounded, which summons you to buy now or to forfeit for ever.   Here, as before, only one element is operative; before it was D,   now it is U. But after all, D was not absent, though inoperative.   The inertness of D allowed U to put forth its total effect. The   practical compression of D being withdrawn, U springs up like   water in a pump when released from the pressure of air. Yet still   that D was present to your thoughts, though the price was   otherwise regulated, is evident; both because U and D must   coexist in order to found any case of exchange value whatever,   and because undeniably you take into very particular   consideration this D, the extreme difficulty of attainment (which   here is the greatest possible, viz. an impossibility) before you   consent to have the price racked up to U. The special D has   vanished; but it is replaced in your thoughts by an unlimited D.   Undoubtedly you have submitted to U in extremity as the   regulating force of the price; but it was under a sense of D's   latent presence. Yet D is so far from exerting any positive   force, that the retirement of D from all agency whatever on the   price-this it is which creates as it were a perfect vacuum, and   through that vacuum U rushes up to its highest and ultimate   gradation.""        This case, in which the value is wholly related by the   necessities or desires of the purchaser, is the case of strict   and absolute monopoly; in which, the article desired being only   obtainable from one person, he can exact any equivalent, short of   the point at which no purchaser could be found. But it is not a   necessary consequence, even of complete monopoly, that the value   should be forced up to this ultimate limit; as will be seen when   we have considered the law of value in so far as depending on the   other element, difficulty of attainment.           2. The difficulty of attainment which determines value, is   not always the same kind of difficulty. It sometimes consists in   an absolute limitation of the supply. There are things of which   it is physically impossible to increase the quantity beyond   certain narrow limits. Such are those wines which can be grown   only in peculiar circumstances of soil, climate, and exposure.   Such also are ancient sculptures; pictures by old masters; rare   books or coins, or other articles of antiquarian curiosity. Among   such may also be reckoned houses and building-ground, in a town   of definite extent (such as Venice, or any fortified town where   fortifications are necessary to security); the most desirable   sites in any town whatever; houses and parks peculiarly favoured   by natural beauty, in places where that advantage is uncommon.   Potentially, all land whatever is a commodity of this class; and   might be practically so, in countries fully occupied and   cultivated.        But there is another category (embracing the majority of all   things that are bought and sold), in which the obstacle to   attainment consists only in the labour and expense requisite to   produce the commodity. Without a certain labour and expense it   cannot be had: but when any one is willing to incur these, there   needs be no limit to the multiplication of the product. If there   were labourers enough and machinery enough, cottons, woollens, or   linens might be produced by thousands of yards for every single   yard now manufactured. There would be a point, no doubt, where   further increase would be stopped by the incapacity of the earth   to afford more of the material. But there is no need, for any   purpose of political economy, to contemplate a time when this   ideal limit could become a practical one.        There is a third case, intermediate between the two   preceding, and rather more complex, which I shall at present   merely indicate, but the importance of which in political economy   is extremely great. There are commodities which can be multiplied   to an indefinite extent by labour and expenditure, but not by a   fixed amount of labour and expenditure. Only a limited quantity   can be produced at a given cost: if more is wanted, it must be   produced at a greater cost. To this class, as has been often   repeated, agricultural produce belongs; and generally all the   rude produce of the earth; and this peculiarity is a source of   very important consequences; one of which is the necessity of a   limit to population; and another, the payment of rent.          3. These being the three classes, in one or other of which   all things that are bought and sold must take their place, we   shall consider them in their order. And first, of things   absolutely limited in quantity, such as ancient sculptures or   pictures.       Of such things it is commonly said, that their value depends   upon their scarcity: but the expression is not sufficiently   definite to serve our purpose. Others say, with somewhat greater   precision, that the value depends on the demand and the supply.   But even this statement requires much explanation, to make it a   clear exponent of the relation between the value of a thing, and   the causes of which that value is an effect.        The supply of a commodity is an intelligible expression: it   means the quantity offered for sale; the quantity that is to be   had, at a given time and place, by those who wish to purchase it.   But what is meant by the demand? Not the mere desire for the   commodity. A beggar may desire a diamond; but his desire, however   great, will have no influence on the price. Writers have   therefore given a more limited sense to demand, and have defined   it, the wish to possess, combined with the power of purchasing.   To distinguish demand in this technical sense, from the demand   which is synonymous with desire, they call the former effectual   demand.(2*) After this explanation, it is usually supposed that   there remains no further difficulty, and that the value depends   upon the ratio between the effectual demand, as thus defined, and   the supply.        These phrases, however, fail to satisfy any one who requires   clear ideas, and a perfectly precise expression of them. Some   confusion must always attach to a phrase so inappropriate as that   of a ratio between two things not of the same denomination. What   ratio can there be between a quantity and a desire, or even a   desire combined with a power? A ratio between demand and supply   is only intelligible if by demand we mean the quantity demanded,   and if the ratio intended is that between the quantity demanded   and the quantity supplied. But again, the quantity demanded is   not a fixed quantity, even at the same time and place; it varies   according to the value; if the thing is cheap, there is usually a   demand for more of it than when it is dear. The demand,   therefore, partly depends on the value. But it was before laid   down that the value depends on the demand. From this   contradiction how shall we extricate ourseLves? How solve the   paradox, of two things, each depending upon the other?        Though the solution of these difficulties is obvious enough,   the difficulties themselves are not fanciful; and I bring them   forward thus prominently, because I am certain that they   obscurely haunt every inquirer into the subject who has not   openly faced and distinctly realized them. Undoubtedly the true   solution must have been frequently given, though I cannot call to   mind any one who had given it before myself, except the eminently   clear thinker and skilful expositor, J.B. Say. I should have   imagined, however, that it must be familiar to all political   economists, if the writings of several did not give evidence of   some want of clearness on the point, and if the instance of Mr.   De Quincey did not prove that the complete non-recognition and   implied denial of it are compatible with great intellectual   ingenuity, and close intimacy with the subject matter.           4. Meaning, by the word demand, the quantity demanded, and   remembering that this is not a fixed quantity, but in general   varies according to the value, let us suppose that the demand at   some particular time exceeds the supply, that is, there are   persons ready to buy, at the market value, a greater quantity   than is offered for sale. Competition takes place on the side of   the buyers, and the value rises: but how much? in the ratio (some   may suppose) of the deficiency: if the demand exceeds the supply   by one-third, the value rises one-third. By no means: for when   the value has risen one-third, the demand may still exceed the   supply; there may, even at that higher value, be a greater   quantity wanted than is to be had; and the competition of buyers   may still continue. If the article is a necessary of life, which,   rather than resign, people are willing to pay for at any price, a   deficiency of one-third may raise the price to double, triple, or   quadruple.(3*) Or, on the contrary, the competition may cease   before the value has risen in even the proportion of the   deficiency. A rise, short of one-third, may place the article   beyond the means, or beyond the inclinations, of purchasers to   the full amount. At what point, then, will the rise be arrested?   At the point, whatever it be, which equalizes the demand and the   supply: at the price which cuts off the extra third from the   demand, or brings forward additional sellers sufficient to supply   it. When, in either of these ways, or by a combination of both,   the demand becomes equal and no more than equal to the supply,   the rise of value will stop.        The converse case is equally simple. instead of a demand   beyond the supply, let us suppose a supply exceeding the demand.   The competition will now be on the side of the sellers: the extra   quantity can only find a market by calling forth an additional   demand equal to itself. This is accomplished by means of   cheapness; the value falls, and brings the article within the   reach of more numerous customers, or induces those who were   already consumers to make increased purchases. The fall of value   required to re-establish equality, is different in different   cases. The kinds of things in which it is commonly greatest are   at the two extremities of the scale; absolute necessaries, or   those peculiar luxuries, the taste for which is confined to a   small class. In the case of food, as those who have already   enough do not require more on account of its cheapness, but   rather expend in other things what they save in food, the   increased consumption occasioned by cheapness, carries off, as   experience shows, only a small part of the extra supply caused by   an abundant harvest;(4*) and the fall is practically arrested   only when the farmers withdraw their corn, and hold it back in   hopes of a higher price; or by the operations of speculators who   buy corn when it is cheap, and store it up to be brought out when   more urgently wanted. Whether the demand and supply are equalized   by an increased demand, the result of cheapness, or by   withdrawing a part of the supply, equalized they are in either   case.        Thus we see that the idea of a ratio, as between demand and   supply, is out of place, and has no concern in the matter: the   proper mathematical analogy is that of an equation. Demand and   supply, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied, will be   made equal. if unequal at any moment, competition equalizes them,   and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the   value. If the demand increases, the value rises; if the demand   diminishes, the value falls: again, if the supply falls off, the   value rises; and falls if the supply is increased. The rise or   the fall continues until the demand and supply are again equal to   one another.. and the value which a commodity will bring in any   market, is no other than the value which, in that market, gives a   demand just sufficient to carry off the existing or expected   supply.        This, then, is the Law of Value, with respect to all   commodities not susceptible of being multiplied at pleasure. Such   commodities, no doubt, are exceptions. There is another law for   that much larger class of things, which admit of indefinite   multiplication. But it is not the less necessary to conceive   distinctly and grasp firmly the theory of this exceptional case.   In the first place, it will be found to be of great assistance in   rendering the more common case intelligible. And in the next   place, the principle of the exception stretches wider, and   embraces more cases, than might at first be supposed.           5. There are but few commodities which are naturally and   necessarily limited in supply. But any commodity whatever may be   artificially so. Any commodity may be the subject of a monopoly:   like tea, in this country, up to 1834; tobacco in France, opium   in British India, at present. The price of a monopolized   commodity is commonly supposed to be arbitrary; depending on the   will of the monopolist, and limited only (as in Mr. De Quincey's   case of the musical box in the wilds of America) by the buyer's   extreme estimate of its worth to himself. This is in one sense   true, but forms no exception, nevertheless, to the dependence of   the value on supply and demand. The monopolist can fix the value   as high as he pleases, short of what the consumer either could   not or would not pay'. but he can only do so by limiting the   supply. The Dutch East India Company obtained a monopoly price   for the produce of the Spice Islands, but to do so they were   obliged, in good seasons, to destroy a portion of the crop. Had   they persisted in selling all that they produced, they must have   forced a market by reducing the price, so low, perhaps, that they   would have received for the larger quantity a less total return   than for the smaller: at least they showed that such was their   opinion by destroying the surplus. Even on Lake Superior, Mr. De   Quincey's huckster could not have sold his box for sixty guineas,   if he had possessed two musical boxes and desired to sell them   both. Supposing the cost price of each to be six guineas, he   would have taken seventy for the two in preference to sixty for   one; that is, although his monopoly was the closest possible, he   would have sold the boxes at thirty-five guineas each,   notwithstanding that sixty was not beyond the buyer's estimate of   the article for his purposes. Monopoly value, therefore, does not   depend on any peculiar principle, but is a mere variety of the   ordinary case of demand and supply.        Again, though there are few commodities which are at all   times and for ever unsusceptible of increase of supply, any   commodity whatever may be temporarily so; and with some   commodities this is habitually the case. Agricultural produce,   for example, cannot be increased in quantity before the next   harvest; the quantity of corn already existing in the world, is   all that can be had for sometimes a year to come. During that   interval, corn is practically assimilated to things Of which the   quantity cannot be increased. In the case of most commodities, it   requires a certain time to increase their quantity; and if the   demand increases, then until a corresponding supply can he   brought forward, that is, until the supply can accommodate itself   to the demand, the value will so rise as to accommodate the   demand to the supply.        There is another case, the exact converse of this. There are   some articles of which the supply may be indefinitely increased,   but cannot be rapidly diminished. There are things so durable   that the quantity in existence is at all times very great in   comparison with the annual produce. Gold, and the more durable   metals, are things of this sort; and also houses. The supply of   such things might be at once diminished by destroying them; but   to do this could only be the interest of the possessor if he had   a monopoly of the article, and could repay himself for the   destruction of a part by the increased value of the remainder.   The value, therefore, of such things may continue for a long time   so low, either from excess of supply or falling off in the   demand, as to put a complete stop to further production; the   diminution of supply by wearing out being so slow a process, that   a long time is requisite, even under a total suspension of   production, to restore the original value. During that interval   the value will be regulated solely by supply and demand, and will   rise very gradually as the existing stock wears out, until there   is again a remunerating value, and production resumes its course.          Finally, there are commodities of which, though capable of   being increased or diminished to a great, and even an unlimited   extent, the value never depends upon anything but demand and   supply. This is the case, in particular, with the commodity   Labour; of the value of which we have treated copiously in the   preceding Book: and there are many cases besides, in which we   shall find it necessary to call in this principle to solve   difficult questions of exchange value. This will be particularly   exemplified when we treat of International Values; that is, of   the terms of interchange between things produced in different   countries, or, to speak more generally, in distant places. But   into these questions we cannot enter, until we shall have   examined the case of commodities which can be increased in   quantity indefinitely and at pleasure; and shall have determined   by what law, other than that of Demand and Supply, the permanent   or average values of such commodities are regulated. This we   shall do in the next chapter.       NOTES:      1. Logic of Political Economy, p. 13.      2. Adam Smith, who introduced the expression ""effectual demand"",   employed it to denote the demand of those who are willing and   able to give for the commodity what he calls its natural price,   that is, the price which will enable it to be permanently   produced and brought to market. -- See his chapter on Natural and   Market Price (book i. ch. 7)      3. ""The price of corn in this country has risen from 100 to 200   per cent and upwards, when the utmost computed deficiency of the   crops has not been more than between one-sixth and one-third   below an average, and when that deficiency has been relieved by   foreign supplies. If there should be a deficiency of the crops   amounting to one-third, without any surplus from a former year,   and without any chance of relief by importation, the price might   rise five, six, or even tenfold."" -- Tooke's History of Prices,   vol. i. pp. 13-5.      4.

825,The Last Days Of Pompeii,63,Edward George Bulwer-lytton,Book01,"CHAPTER X        On assembling at the residence indicated, the tchinovniks had occasion    to remark that, owing to all these cares and excitements, every one of    their number had grown thinner. Yes, the appointment of a new    Governor-General, coupled with the rumours described and the reception    of the two serious documents above-mentioned, had left manifest traces    upon the features of every one present. More than one frockcoat had    come to look too large for its wearer, and more than one frame had    fallen away, including the frames of the President of the Council, the    Director of the Medical Department, and the Public Prosecutor. Even a    certain Semen Ivanovitch, who, for some reason or another, was never    alluded to by his family name, but who wore on his index finger a ring    with which he was accustomed to dazzle his lady friends, had    diminished in bulk. Yet, as always happens at such junctures, there    were also present a score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in    NOT losing their presence of mind, even though they constituted a    mere sprinkling. Of them the Postmaster formed one, since he was a man    of equable temperament who could always say: ""WE know you,    Governor-Generals! We have seen three or four of you come and go,    whereas WE have been sitting on the same stools these thirty years.""    Nevertheless a prominent feature of the gathering was the total    absence of what is vulgarly known as ""common sense."" In general, we    Russians do not make a good show at representative assemblies, for the    reason that, unless there be in authority a leading spirit to control    the rest, the affair always develops into confusion. Why this should    be so one could hardly say, but at all events a success is scored only    by such gatherings as have for their object dining and festivity--to    wit, gatherings at clubs or in German-run restaurants. However, on the    present occasion, the meeting was NOT one of this kind; it was a    meeting convoked of necessity, and likely in view of the threatened    calamity to affect every tchinovnik in the place. Also, in addition to    the great divergency of views expressed thereat, there was visible in    all the speakers an invincible tendency to indecision which led them    at one moment to make assertions, and at the next to contradict the    same. But on at least one point all seemed to agree--namely, that    Chichikov's appearance and conversation were too respectable for him    to be a forger or a disguised brigand. That is to say, all SEEMED to    agree on the point; until a sudden shout arose from the direction of    the Postmaster, who for some time past had been sitting plunged in thought.        ""_I_ can tell you,"" he cried, ""who Chichikov is!""        ""Who, then?"" replied the crowd in great excitement.        ""He is none other than Captain Kopeikin.""        ""And who may Captain Kopeikin be?""        Taking a pinch of snuff (which he did with the lid of his snuff-box    half-open, lest some extraneous person should contrive to insert a not    over-clean finger into the stuff), the Postmaster related the    following story[1].        [1] To reproduce this story with a raciness worthy of the Russian        original is practically impossible. The translator has not        attempted the task.        ""After fighting in the campaign of 1812, there was sent home, wounded,    a certain Captain Kopeikin--a headstrong, lively blade who, whether on    duty or under arrest, made things lively for everybody. Now, since at    Krasni or at Leipzig (it matters not which) he had lost an arm and a    leg, and in those days no provision was made for wounded soldiers, and    he could not work with his left arm alone, he set out to see his    father. Unfortunately his father could only just support himself, and    was forced to tell his son so; wherefore the Captain decided to go and    apply for help in St. Petersburg, seeing that he had risked his life    for his country, and had lost much blood in its service. You can    imagine him arriving in the capital on a baggage waggon--in the    capital which is like no other city in the world! Before him there lay    spread out the whole field of life, like a sort of Arabian Nights--a    picture made up of the Nevski Prospect, Gorokhovaia Street, countless    tapering spires, and a number of bridges apparently supported on    nothing--in fact, a regular second Nineveh. Well, he made shift to    hire a lodging, but found everything so wonderfully furnished with    blinds and Persian carpets and so forth that he saw it would mean    throwing away a lot of money. True, as one walks the streets of St.    Petersburg one seems to smell money by the thousand roubles, but our    friend Kopeikin's bank was limited to a few score coppers and a little    silver--not enough to buy a village with! At length, at the price of a    rouble a day, he obtained a lodging in the sort of tavern where the    daily ration is a bowl of cabbage soup and a crust of bread; and as he    felt that he could not manage to live very long on fare of that kind    he asked folk what he had better do. 'What you had better do?' they    said. 'Well the Government is not here--it is in Paris, and the troops    have not yet returned from the war; but there is a TEMPORARY    Commission sitting, and you had better go and see what IT can do for    you.' 'All right!' he said. 'I will go and tell the Commission that I    have shed my blood, and sacrificed my life, for my country.' And he    got up early one morning, and shaved himself with his left hand (since    the expense of a barber was not worth while), and set out, wooden leg    and all, to see the President of the Commission. But first he asked    where the President lived, and was told that his house was in    Naberezhnaia Street. And you may be sure that it was no peasant's hut,    with its glazed windows and great mirrors and statues and lacqueys and    brass door handles! Rather, it was the sort of place which you would    enter only after you had bought a cheap cake of soap and indulged in a    two hours' wash. Also, at the entrance there was posted a grand Swiss    footman with a baton and an embroidered collar--a fellow looking like    a fat, over-fed pug dog. However, friend Kopeikin managed to get    himself and his wooden leg into the reception room, and there squeezed    himself away into a corner, for fear lest he should knock down the    gilded china with his elbow. And he stood waiting in great    satisfaction at having arrived before the President had so much as    left his bed and been served with his silver wash-basin. Nevertheless,    it was only when Kopeikin had been waiting four hours that a breakfast    waiter entered to say, 'The President will soon be here.' By now the    room was as full of people as a plate is of beans, and when the    President left the breakfast-room he brought with him, oh, such    dignity and refinement, and such an air of the metropolis! First he    walked up to one person, and then up to another, saying: 'What do    YOU want? And what do YOU want? What can I do for YOU? What is    YOUR business?' And at length he stopped before Kopeikin, and    Kopeikin said to him: 'I have shed my blood, and lost both an arm and    a leg, for my country, and am unable to work. Might I therefore dare    to ask you for a little help, if the regulations should permit of it,    or for a gratuity, or for a pension, or something of the kind?' Then    the President looked at him, and saw that one of his legs was indeed a    wooden one, and that an empty right sleeve was pinned to his uniform.    'Very well,' he said. 'Come to me again in a few days' time.' Upon    this friend Kopeikin felt delighted. 'NOW I have done my job!' he    thought to himself; and you may imagine how gaily he trotted along the    pavement, and how he dropped into a tavern for a glass of vodka, and    how he ordered a cutlet and some caper sauce and some other things for    luncheon, and how he called for a bottle of wine, and how he went to    the theatre in the evening! In short, he did himself thoroughly well.    Next, he saw in the street a young English lady, as graceful as a    swan, and set off after her on his wooden leg. 'But no,' he thought to    himself. 'To the devil with that sort of thing just now! I will wait    until I have drawn my pension. For the present I have spent enough.'    (And I may tell you that by now he had got through fully half his    money.) Two or three days later he went to see the President of the    Commission again. 'I should be glad to know,' he said, 'whether by now    you can do anything for me in return for my having shed my blood and    suffered sickness and wounds on military service.' 'First of all,'    said the President, 'I must tell you that nothing can be decided in    your case without the authority of the Supreme Government. Without    that sanction we cannot move in the matter. Surely you see how things    stand until the army shall have returned from the war? All that I can    advise you to do is wait for the Minister to return, and, in the    meanwhile, to have patience. Rest assured that then you will not be    overlooked. And if for the moment you have nothing to live upon, this    is the best that I can do for you.' With that he handed Kopeikin a    trifle until his case should have been decided. However, that was not    what Kopeikin wanted. He had supposed that he would be given a    gratuity of a thousand roubles straight away; whereas, instead of     'Drink and be merry,' it was 'Wait, for the time is not yet.' Thus,    though his head had been full of soup plates and cutlets and English    girls, he now descended the steps with his ears and his tail    down--looking, in fact, like a poodle over which the cook has poured a    bucketful of water. You see, St. Petersburg life had changed him not a    little since first he had got a taste of it, and, now that the devil    only knew how he was going to live, it came all the harder to him that    he should have no more sweets to look forward to. Remember that a man    in the prime of years has an appetite like a wolf; and as he passed a    restaurant he could see a round-faced, holland-shirted, snow-white    aproned fellow of a French chef preparing a dish delicious enough to    make it turn to and eat itself; while, again, as he passed a fruit    shop he could see delicacies looking out of a window for fools to come    and buy them at a hundred roubles apiece. Imagine, therefore, his    position! On the one hand, so to speak, were salmon and water-melons,    while on the other hand was the bitter fare which passed at a tavern    for luncheon. 'Well,' he thought to himself, 'let them do what they    like with me at the Commission, but I intend to go and raise the whole    place, and to tell every blessed functionary there that I have a mind    to do as I choose.' And in truth this bold impertinence of a man did    have the hardihood to return to the Commission. 'What do you want?'    said the President. 'Why are you here for the third time? You have had    your orders given you.' 'I daresay I have,' he retorted, 'but I am not    going to be put off with THEM. I want some cutlets to eat, and a    bottle of French wine, and a chance to go and amuse myself at the    theatre.' 'Pardon me,' said the President. 'What you really need (if I    may venture to mention it) is a little patience. You have been given    something for food until the Military Committee shall have met, and    then, doubtless, you will receive your proper reward, seeing that it    would not be seemly that a man who has served his country should be    left destitute. On the other hand, if, in the meanwhile, you desire to    indulge in cutlets and theatre-going, please understand that we cannot    help you, but you must make your own resources, and try as best you    can to help yourself.' You can imagine that this went in at one of    Kopeikin's ears, and out at the other; that it was like shooting peas    at a stone wall. Accordingly he raised a turmoil which sent the staff    flying. One by one, he gave the mob of secretaries and clerks a real    good hammering. 'You, and you, and you,' he said, 'do not even know    your duties. You are law-breakers.' Yes, he trod every man of them    under foot. At length the General himself arrived from another office,    and sounded the alarm. What was to be done with a fellow like    Kopeikin? The President saw that strong measures were imperative.    'Very well,' he said. 'Since you decline to rest satisfied with what    has been given you, and quietly to await the decision of your case in    St. Petersburg, I must find you a lodging. Here, constable, remove the    man to gaol.' Then a constable who had been called to the door--a    constable three ells in height, and armed with a carbine--a man well    fitted to guard a bank--placed our friend in a police waggon. 'Well,'    reflected Kopeikin, 'at least I shan't have to pay my fare for THIS    ride. That's one comfort.' Again, after he had ridden a little way, he    said to himself: 'they told me at the Commission to go and make my own    means of enjoying myself. Very good. I'll do so.' However, what became    of Kopeikin, and whither he went, is known to no one. He sank, to use    the poet's expression, into the waters of Lethe, and his doings now    lie buried in oblivion. But allow me, gentlemen, to piece together the    further threads of the story. Not two months later there appeared in    the forests of Riazan a band of robbers: and of that band the    chieftain was none other than--""        ""Allow me,"" put in the Head of the Police Department. ""You have said    that Kopeikin had lost an arm and a leg; whereas Chichikov--""        To say anything more was unnecessary. The Postmaster clapped his hand    to his forehead, and publicly called himself a fool, though, later, he    tried to excuse his mistake by saying that in England the science of    mechanics had reached such a pitch that wooden legs were manufactured    which would enable the wearer, on touching a spring, to vanish    instantaneously from sight.        Various other theories were then propounded, among them a theory that    Chichikov was Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena and travelling about    the world in disguise. And if it should be supposed that no such    notion could possibly have been broached, let the reader remember that    these events took place not many years after the French had been    driven out of Russia, and that various prophets had since declared    that Napoleon was Antichrist, and would one day escape from his island    prison to exercise universal sway on earth. Nay, some good folk had    even declared the letters of Napoleon's name to constitute the    Apocalyptic cipher!        As a last resort, the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev, since    not only had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls, but    also he was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov.    Accordingly the Chief of Police dispatched a note by the hand of a    commissionaire. At the time Nozdrev was engaged on some very important    business--so much so that he had not left his room for four days, and    was receiving his meals through the window, and no visitors at all.    The business referred to consisted of the marking of several dozen    selected cards in such a way as to permit of his relying upon them as    upon his bosom friend. Naturally he did not like having his retirement    invaded, and at first consigned the commissionaire to the devil; but    as soon as he learnt from the note that, since a novice at cards was    to be the guest of the Chief of Police that evening, a call at the    latter's house might prove not wholly unprofitable he relented,    unlocked the door of his room, threw on the first garments that came    to hand, and set forth. To every question put to him by the    tchinovniks he answered firmly and with assurance. Chichikov, he    averred, had indeed purchased dead souls, and to the tune of several    thousand roubles. In fact, he (Nozdrev) had himself sold him some, and    still saw no reason why he should not have done so. Next, to the    question of whether or not he considered Chichikov to be a spy, he    replied in the affirmative, and added that, as long ago as his and    Chichikov's joint schooldays, the said Chichikov had been known as    ""The Informer,"" and repeatedly been thrashed by his companions on that    account. Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov was a    forger of currency notes the deponent, as before, responded in the    affirmative, and appended thereto an anecdote illustrative of    Chichikov's extraordinary dexterity of hand--namely, an anecdote to    that effect that, once upon a time, on learning that two million    roubles worth of counterfeit notes were lying in Chichikov's house,    the authorities had placed seals upon the building, and had surrounded    it on every side with an armed guard; whereupon Chichikov had, during    the night, changed each of these seals for a new one, and also so    arranged matters that, when the house was searched, the forged notes    were found to be genuine ones!        Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov had schemed to    abduct the Governor's daughter, and also whether it was true that he,    Nozdrev, had undertaken to aid and abet him in the act, the witness    replied that, had he not undertaken to do so, the affair would never    have come off. At this point the witness pulled himself up, on    realising that he had told a lie which might get him into trouble; but    his tongue was not to be denied--the details trembling on its tip were    too alluring, and he even went on to cite the name of the village    church where the pair had arranged to be married, that of the priest    who had performed the ceremony, the amount of the fees paid for the    same (seventy-five roubles), and statements (1) that the priest had    refused to solemnise the wedding until Chichikov had frightened him by    threatening to expose the fact that he (the priest) had married    Mikhail, a local corn dealer, to his paramour, and (2) that Chichikov    had ordered both a koliaska for the couple's conveyance and relays of    horses from the post-houses on the road. Nay, the narrative, as    detailed by Nozdrev, even reached the point of his mentioning certain    of the postillions by name! Next, the tchinovniks sounded him on the    question of Chichikov's possible identity with Napoleon; but before    long they had reason to regret the step, for Nozdrev responded with a    rambling rigmarole such as bore no resemblance to anything possibly    conceivable. Finally, the majority of the audience left the room, and    only the Chief of Police remained to listen (in the hope of gathering    something more); but at last even he found himself forced to disclaim    the speaker with a gesture which said: ""The devil only knows what the    fellow is talking about!"" and so voiced the general opinion that it    was no use trying to gather figs of thistles.        Meanwhile Chichikov knew nothing of these events; for, having    contracted a slight chill, coupled with a sore throat, he had decided    to keep his room for three days; during which time he gargled his    throat with milk and fig juice, consumed the fruit from which the    juice had been extracted, and wore around his neck a poultice of    camomile and camphor. Also, to while away the hours, he made new and    more detailed lists of the souls which he had bought, perused a work    by the Duchesse de la Valliere[2], rummaged in his portmanteau, looked    through various articles and papers which he discovered in his    dispatch-box, and found every one of these occupations tedious. Nor    could he understand why none of his official friends had come to see    him and inquire after his health, seeing that, not long since, there    had been standing in front of the inn the drozhkis both of the    Postmaster, the Public Prosecutor, and the President of the Council.    He wondered and wondered, and then, with a shrug of his shoulders,    fell to pacing the room. At length he felt better, and his spirits    rose at the prospect of once more going out into the fresh air;    wherefore, having shaved a plentiful growth of hair from his face, he    dressed with such alacrity as almost to cause a split in his trousers,    sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne, and wrapping himself in warm    clothes, and turning up the collar of his coat, sallied forth into the    street. His first destination was intended to be the Governor's    mansion, and, as he walked along, certain thoughts concerning the    Governor's daughter would keep whirling through his head, so that    almost he forgot where he was, and took to smiling and cracking jokes    to himself.        [2] One of the mistresses of Louis XIV. of France. In 1680 she wrote a        book called Reflexions sur la Misericorde de Dieu, par une Dame        Penitente.        Arrived at the Governor's entrance, he was about to divest himself of    his scarf when a Swiss footman greeted him with the words, ""I am    forbidden to admit you.""        ""What?"" he exclaimed. ""You do not know me? Look at me again, and see    if you do not recognise me.""        ""Of course I recognise you,"" the footman replied. ""I have seen you    before, but have been ordered to admit any one else rather than    Monsieur Chichikov.""        ""Indeed? And why so?""        ""Those are my orders, and they must be obeyed,"" said the footman,    confronting Chichikov with none of that politeness with which, on    former occasions, he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings.    Evidently he was of opinion that, since the gentry declined to receive    the visitor, the latter must certainly be a rogue.        ""I cannot understand it,"" said Chichikov to himself. Then he departed,    and made his way to the house of the President of the Council. But so    put about was that official by Chichikov's entry that he could not    utter two consecutive words--he could only murmur some rubbish which    left both his visitor and himself out of countenance. Chichikov    wondered, as he left the house, what the President's muttered words    could have meant, but failed to make head or tail of them. Next, he    visited, in turn, the Chief of Police, the Vice-Governor, the    Postmaster, and others; but in each case he either failed to be    accorded admittance or was received so strangely, and with such a    measure of constraint and conversational awkwardness and absence of    mind and embarrassment, that he began to fear for the sanity of his    hosts. Again and again did he strive to divine the cause, but could    not do so; so he went wandering aimlessly about the town, without    succeeding in making up his mind whether he or the officials had gone    crazy. At length, in a state bordering upon bewilderment, he returned    to the inn--to the establishment whence, that every afternoon, he had    set forth in such exuberance of spirits. Feeling the need of something    to do, he ordered tea, and, still marvelling at the strangeness of his    position, was about to pour out the beverage when the door opened and    Nozdrev made his appearance.        ""What says the proverb?"" he began. ""'To see a friend, seven versts is    not too long a round to make.' I happened to be passing the house, saw    a light in your window, and thought to myself: 'Now, suppose I were to    run up and pay him a visit? It is unlikely that he will be asleep.'    Ah, ha! I see tea on your table! Good! Then I will drink a cup with    you, for I had wretched stuff for dinner, and it is beginning to lie    heavy on my stomach. Also, tell your man to fill me a pipe. Where is    your own pipe?""        ""I never smoke,"" rejoined Chichikov drily.        ""Rubbish! As if I did not know what a chimney-pot you are! What is    your man's name? Hi, Vakhramei! Come here!""        ""Petrushka is his name, not Vakhramei.""        ""Indeed? But you USED to have a man called Vakhramei, didn't you?""        ""No, never.""        ""Oh, well. Then it must be Derebin's man I am thinking of. What a    lucky fellow that Derebin is! An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled    with her son for marrying a serf woman, and has left all her property    to HIM, to Derebin. Would that _I_ had an aunt of that kind to    provide against future contingencies! But why have you been hiding    yourself away? I suppose the reason has been that you go in for    abstruse subjects and are fond of reading"" (why Nozdrev should have    drawn these conclusions no one could possibly have said--least of all    Chichikov himself). ""By the way, I can tell you of something that    would have found you scope for your satirical vein"" (the conclusion as    to Chichikov's ""satirical vein"" was, as before, altogether unwarranted    on Nozdrev's part). ""That is to say, you would have seen merchant    Likhachev losing a pile of money at play. My word, you would have    laughed! A fellow with me named Perependev said: 'Would that Chichikov    had been here! It would have been the very thing for him!'"" (As a    matter of fact, never since the day of his birth had Nozdrev met any    one of the name of Perependev.) ""However, my friend, you must admit    that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that game of    chess; but, as I won the game, I bear you no malice. A propos, I am    just from the President's, and ought to tell you that the feeling    against you in the town is very strong, for every one believes you to    be a forger of currency notes. I myself was sent for and questioned    about you, but I stuck up for you through thick and thin, and told the    tchinovniks that I had been at school with you, and had known your    father. In fact, I gave the fellows a knock or two for themselves.""        ""You say that I am believed to be a forger?"" said Chichikov, starting    from his seat.        ""Yes,"" said Nozdrev. ""Why have you gone and frightened everybody as    you have done? Some of our folk are almost out of their minds about    it, and declare you to be either a brigand in disguise or a spy.    Yesterday the Public Prosecutor even died of it, and is to be buried    to-morrow"" (this was true in so far as that, on the previous day, the    official in question had had a fatal stroke--probably induced by the    excitement of the public meeting). ""Of course, _I_ don't suppose you    to be anything of the kind, but, you see, these fellows are in a blue    funk about the new Governor-General, for they think he will make    trouble for them over your affair. A propos, he is believed to be a    man who puts on airs, and turns up his nose at everything; and if so,    he will get on badly with the dvoriane, seeing that fellows of that    sort need to be humoured a bit. Yes, my word! Should the new    Governor-General shut himself up in his study, and give no balls,    there will be the very devil to pay! By the way, Chichikov, that is a    risky scheme of yours.""        ""What scheme to you mean?"" Chichikov asked uneasily.        ""Why, that scheme of carrying off the Governor's daughter. However, to    tell the truth, I was expecting something of the kind. No sooner did I    see you and her together at the ball than I said to myself: 'Ah, ha!    Chichikov is not here for nothing!' For my own part, I think you have    made a poor choice, for I can see nothing in her at all. On the other    hand, the niece of a friend of mine named Bikusov--she IS a girl,    and no mistake! A regular what you might call 'miracle in muslin!'""        ""What on earth are you talking about?"" asked Chichikov with his eyes    distended. ""HOW could I carry off the Governor's daughter? What on    earth do you mean?""        ""Come, come! What a secretive fellow you are! My only object in having    come to see you is to lend you a helping hand in the matter. Look    here. On condition that you will lend me three thousand roubles, I    will stand you the cost of the wedding, the koliaska, and the relays    of horses. I must have the money even if I die for it.""        Throughout Nozdrev's maunderings Chichikov had been rubbing his eyes    to ascertain whether or not he was dreaming. What with the charge of    being a forger, the accusation of having schemed an abduction, the    death of the Public Prosecutor (whatever might have been its cause),    and the advent of a new Governor-General, he felt utterly dismayed.        ""Things having come to their present pass,"" he reflected, ""I had    better not linger here--I had better be off at once.""        Getting rid of Nozdrev as soon as he could, he sent for Selifan, and    ordered him to be up at daybreak, in order to clean the britchka and    to have everything ready for a start at six o'clock. Yet, though    Selifan replied, ""Very well, Paul Ivanovitch,"" he hesitated awhile by    the door. Next, Chichikov bid Petrushka get out the dusty portmanteau    from under the bed, and then set to work to cram into it, pell-mell,    socks, shirts, collars (both clean and dirty), boot trees, a calendar,    and a variety of other articles. Everything went into the receptacle    just as it came to hand, since his one object was to obviate any    possible delay in the morning's departure. Meanwhile the reluctant    Selifan slowly, very slowly, left the room, as slowly descended the    staircase (on each separate step of which he left a muddy foot-print),    and, finally, halted to scratch his head. What that scratching may    have meant no one could say; for, with the Russian populace, such a    scratching may mean any one of a hundred things.    "

875,"The Origin Of The Family, Private Property And The State",92,Frederick Engles,Preface-1,"The Principles of Political Economy   by John Stuart Mill      Book 3: Distribution      Chapter 10      Of a Double Standard, and Subsidiary Coins          1. Though the qualities necessary to fit any commodity for   being used as money are rarely united in any considerable   perfection, there are two commodities which possess them in an   eminent, and nearly an equal degree; the two precious metals, as   they are called; gold and silver. Some nations have accordingly   attempted to compose their circulating medium of these two metals   indiscriminately. There is an obvious convenience in making use   of the more costly metal for larger payments, and the cheaper one   for smaller; and the only question relates to the mode in which   this can best be done. The mode most frequently adopted has been   to establish between the two metals a fixed proportion; to   decide, for example, that a gold coin called a sovereign should   be equivalent to twenty of the silver coins called shillings:   both the one and the other being called, in the ordinary money of   account of the country, by the same denomination, a pound: and it   being left free to every one who has a pound to pay, either to   pay it in the one metal or in the other.        At the time when the valuation of the two metals relatively   to each other, say twenty shillings to the sovereign, or   twenty-one shillings to the guinea, was first made, the   proportion probably corresponded, as nearly as it could be made   to do, with the ordinary relative values of the two metals   grounded on their cost of production: and if those natural or   cost values always continued to bear the same ratio to one   another, the arrangement would be unobjectionable. This, however,   is far from being the fact. Gold and silver, though the least   variable in value of all commodities, are not invariable, and do   not always vary simultaneously. Silver, for example, was lowered   in permanent value more than gold, by the discovery of the   American mines; and those smal1 variations of value which take   place occasionally, do not affect both metals alike. Suppose such   a variation to take place: the value of the two metals relatively   to one another no longer agreeing with their rated proportion,   one or other of them will now be rated below its bullion value,   and there will be a profit to be made by melting it.        Suppose, for example, that gold rises in value relatively to   silver, so that the quantity of gold in a sovereign is now worth   more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings. Two   consequences will ensue. No debtor will any longer find it his   interest to pay in gold. He will always pay in silver, because   twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound, and   he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less   gold than that contained in a sovereign. The other consequence   will be, that unless a sovereign can be sold for more than twenty   shillings, all the sovereigns will be melted, since as bullion   they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they   exchange for as coin. The converse of all this would happen if   silver, instead of gold, were the metal which had risen in   comparative value. A sovereign would not now be worth so much as   twenty shillings, and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer   paying it by a sovereign; while the silver coins would be   collected for the purpose of being melted, and sold as bullion   for gold at their real value, that is, above the legal valuation.   The money of the community, therefore, would never really consist   of both metals, but of the one only which, at the particular   time, best suited the interest of debtors; and the standard of   the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one   metal to the other, at a loss, on each change, of the expense of   coinage on the metal which fell out of use.        It appears, therefore, that the value of money is liable to   more frequent fluctuations when both metals are a legal tender at   a fixed valuation, than when the exclusive standard of the   currency is either gold or silver. Instead of being only affected   by variations in the cost of production of one metal, it is   subject to derangement from those of two. The particular kind of   variation to which a currency is rendered more liable by having   two legal standards, is a fall of value, or what is commonly   called a depreciation; since practically that one of the two   metals will always be the standard, of which the real has fallen   below the rated value. If the tendency of the metals be to rise   in value, all payments will be made in the one which has risen   least; and if to fall, then in that which has fallen most.           2. The plan of a double standard is still occasionally   brought forward by here and there a writer or orator as a great   improvement in currency. It is probable that, with most of its   adherents, its chief merit is its tendency to a sort of   depreciation, there being at all times abundance of supporters   for any mode, either open or covert, of lowering the standard.   Some, however, are influenced by an exaggerated estimate of an   advantage which to a certain extent is real, that of being able   to have recourse, for replenishing the circulation, to the united   stock of gold and silver in the commercial world, instead of   being confined to one of them, which, from accidental absorption,   may not be obtainable with sufficient rapidity. The advantage   without the disadvantages of a double standard, seems to be best   obtained by those nations with whom one only of the two metals is   a legal tender, but the other also is coined, and allowed to pass   for whatever value the market assigns to it.        When this plan is adopted, it is naturally the more costly   metal which is left to be bought and sold as an article of   commerce. But nations which, like England, adopt the more costly   of the two as their standard, resort to a different expedient for   retaining them both in circulation, namely, to make silver a   legal tender, but only for small payments. In England, no one can   be compelled to receive silver in payment for a larger amount   than forty shillings. With this regulation there is necessarily   combined another, namely, that silver coin should be rated, in   comparison with gold, somewhat above its intrinsic value; that   there should not be, in twenty shillings, as much silver as is   worth a sovereign: for if there were, a very slight turn of the   market in its favour would make it worth more than a sovereign,   and it would be profitable to melt the silver coin. The   over-valuation of the silver coin creates an inducement to buy   silver and send it to the Mint to be coined, since it is given   back at a higher value than properly belongs to it: this,   however, has been guarded against, by limiting the quantity of   the silver coinage, which is not left, like that of gold, to the   discretion of individuals, but is determined by the government,   and restricted to the amount supposed to be required for small   payments. The only precaution necessary is, not to put so high a   valuation upon the silver, as to hold out a strong temptation to   private coining.       "
899,The Principles Of Economics,8,Alfred Marshall  ,Book03,"Chapter XXX        The Delivery of the Letter            THE next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of    church, hoping for an invitation to go home with them.  He had the    letter in his pocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of    talking to Hetty alone.  He could not see her face at church, for    she had changed her seat, and when he came up to her to shake    hands, her manner was doubtful and constrained.  He expected this,    for it was the first time she had met him since she had been aware    that he had seen her with Arthur in the Grove.        ""Come, you'll go on with us, Adam,"" Mr. Poyser said when they    reached the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam    ventured to offer his arm to Hetty.  The children soon gave them    an opportunity of lingering behind a little, and then Adam said:        ""Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you    this evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty?  I've something partic'lar    to talk to you about.""        Hetty said, ""Very well.""  She was really as anxious as Adam was    that she should have some private talk with him.  She wondered    what he thought of her and Arthur.  He must have seen them    kissing, she knew, but she had no conception of the scene that had    taken place between Arthur and Adam.  Her first feeling had been    that Adam would be very angry with her, and perhaps would tell her    aunt and uncle, but it never entered her mind that he would dare    to say anything to Captain Donnithorne.  It was a relief to her    that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted to speak to    her alone, for she had trembled when she found he was going home    with them lest he should mean ""to tell.""  But, now he wanted to    talk to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what    he meant to do.  She felt a certain confidence that she could    persuade him not to do anything she did not want him to do; she    could perhaps even make him believe that she didn't care for    Arthur; and as long as Adam thought there was any hope of her    having him, he would do just what she liked, she knew.  Besides,    she MUST go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her uncle and aunt    should be angry and suspect her of having some secret lover.        Hetty's little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on    Adam's arm and said ""yes"" or ""no"" to some slight observations of    his about the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds    this next winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly    hold up till morning.  And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle,    she could pursue her thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser    held that though a young man might like to have the woman he was    courting on his arm, he would nevertheless be glad of a little    reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his own part,    he was curious to heal the most recent news about the Chase Farm.     So, through the rest of the walk, he claimed Adam's conversation    for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots and imagined her    little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked along by the    hedgerows on honest Adam's arm, quite as well as if she had been    an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir.  For if a country    beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is    astonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of    a lady in society and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect    to the problem of committing indiscretions without compromising    herself.  Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less because    Hetty felt very unhappy all the while.  The parting with Arthur    was a double pain to her--mingling with the tumult of passion and    vanity there was a dim undefined fear that the future might shape    itself in some way quite unlike her dream.  She clung to the    comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their last meeting--    ""I shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see what can    be done.""  She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her, he    would never be happy without her; and she still hugged her secret--    that a great gentleman loved her--with gratified pride, as a    superiority over all the girls she knew.  But the uncertainty of    the future, the possibilities to which she could give no shape,    began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air; she was    alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the    dark unknown water where Arthur was gone.  She could gather no    elation of spirits now by looking forward, but only by looking    backward to build confidence on past words and caresses.  But    occasionally, since Thursday evening, her dim anxieties had been    almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might betray    what he knew to her uncle and aunt, and his sudden proposition to    talk with her alone had set her thoughts to work in a new way.     She was eager not to lose this evening's opportunity; and after    tea, when the boys were going into the garden and Totty begged to    go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised Mrs.    Poyser, ""I'll go with her, Aunt.""        It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too,    and soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the    filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the    large unripe nuts to play at ""cob-nut"" with, and Totty was    watching them with a puppylike air of contemplation.  It was but a    short time--hardly two months--since Adam had had his mind filled    with delicious hopes as he stood by Hetty's side un this garden.     The remembrance of that scene had often been with him since    Thursday evening: the sunlight through the apple-tree boughs, the    red bunches, Hetty's sweet blush.  It came importunately now, on    this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but he tried to    suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say more than    was needful for Hetty's sake.        ""After what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,"" he began, ""you won't    think me making too free in what I'm going to say.  If you was    being courted by any man as 'ud make you his wife, and I'd known    you was fond of him and meant to have him, I should have no right    to speak a word to you about it; but when I see you're being made    love to by a gentleman as can never marry you, and doesna think o'    marrying you, I feel bound t' interfere for you.  I can't speak    about it to them as are i' the place o' your parents, for that    might bring worse trouble than's needful.""        Adam's words relieved one of Hetty's fears, but they also carried    a meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding.  She    was pale and trembling, and yet she would have angrily    contradicted Adam, if she had dared to betray her feelings.  But    she was silent.        ""You're so young, you know, Hetty,"" he went on, almost tenderly,    ""and y' haven't seen much o' what goes on in the world.  It's    right for me to do what I can to save you from getting into    trouble for want o' your knowing where you're being led to.  If    anybody besides me knew what I know about your meeting a gentleman    and having fine presents from him, they'd speak light on you, and    you'd lose your character.  And besides that, you'll have to    suffer in your feelings, wi' giving your love to a man as can    never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your life.""        Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from    the filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand.  Her little    plans and preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-    learnt lesson, under the terrible agitation produced by Adam's    words.  There was a cruel force in their calm certainty which    threatened to grapple and crush her flimsy hopes and fancies.  She    wanted to resist them--she wanted to throw them off with angry    contradiction--but the determination to conceal what she felt    still governed her.  It was nothing more than a blind prompting    now, for she was unable to calculate the effect of her words.        ""You've no right to say as I love him,"" she said, faintly, but    impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up.  She    was very beautiful in her paleness and agitation, with her dark    childish eyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual.  Adam's    heart yearned over her as he looked at her.  Ah, if he could but    comfort her, and soothe her, and save her from this pain; if he    had but some sort of strength that would enable him to rescue her    poor troubled mind, as he would have rescued her body in the face    of all danger!        ""I doubt it must be so, Hetty,"" he said, tenderly; ""for I canna    believe you'd let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a    gold box with his hair, and go a-walking i' the Grove to meet him,    if you didna love him.  I'm not blaming you, for I know it 'ud    begin by little and little, till at last you'd not be able to    throw it off.  It's him I blame for stealing your love i' that    way, when he knew he could never make you the right amends.  He's    been trifling with you, and making a plaything of you, and caring    nothing about you as a man ought to care.""        ""Yes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,"" Hetty burst    out.  Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at    Adam's words.        ""Nay, Hetty,"" said Adam, ""if he'd cared for you rightly, he'd    never ha' behaved so.  He told me himself he meant nothing by his    kissing and presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you    thought light of 'em too.  But I know better nor that.  I can't    help thinking as you've been trusting to his loving you well    enough to marry you, for all he's a gentleman.  And that's why I    must speak to you about it, Hetty, for fear you should be    deceiving yourself.  It's never entered his head the thought o'    marrying you.""        ""How do you know?  How durst you say so?"" said Hetty, pausing in    her walk and trembling.  The terrible decision of Adam's tone    shook her with fear.  She had no presence of mind left for the    reflection that Arthur would have his reasons for not telling the    truth to Adam.  Her words and look were enough to determine Adam:    he must give her the letter.        ""Perhaps you can't believe me, Hetty, because you think too well    of him--because you think he loves you better than he does.  But    I've got a letter i' my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give    you.  I've not read the letter, but he says he's told you the    truth in it.  But before I give you the letter, consider, Hetty,    and don't let it take too much hold on you.  It wouldna ha' been    good for you if he'd wanted to do such a mad thing as marry you:    it 'ud ha' led to no happiness i' th' end.""        Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a    letter which Adam had not read.  There would be something quite    different in it from what he thought.        Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while    he said, in a tone of tender entreaty, ""Don't you bear me ill    will, Hetty, because I'm the means o' bringing you this pain.  God    knows I'd ha' borne a good deal worse for the sake o' sparing it    you.  And think--there's nobody but me knows about this, and I'll    take care of you as if I was your brother.  You're the same as    ever to me, for I don't believe you've done any wrong knowingly.""        Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it    till he had done speaking.  She took no notice of what he said--    she had not listened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it    into her pocket, without opening it, and then began to walk more    quickly, as if she wanted to go in.        ""You're in the right not to read it just yet,"" said Adam.  ""Read    it when you're by yourself.  But stay out a little bit longer, and    let us call the children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may    take notice of it.""        Hetty heard the warning.  It recalled to her the necessity of    rallying her native powers of concealment, which had half given    way under the shock of Adam's words.  And she had the letter in    her pocket: she was sure there was comfort in that letter in spite    of Adam.  She ran to find Totty, and soon reappeared with    recovered colour, leading Totty, who was making a sour face    because she had been obliged to throw away an unripe apple that    she had set her small teeth in.        ""Hegh, Totty,"" said Adam, ""come and ride on my shoulder--ever so    high--you'll touch the tops o' the trees.""        What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious    sense of being seized strongly and swung upward?  I don't believe    Ganymede cried when the eagle carried him away, and perhaps    deposited him on Jove's shoulder at the end.  Totty smiled down    complacently from her secure height, and pleasant was the sight to    the mother's eyes, as she stood at the house door and saw Adam    coming with his small burden.        ""Bless your sweet face, my pet,"" she said, the mother's strong    love filling her keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward    and put out her arms.  She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment,    and only said, without looking at her, ""You go and draw some ale,    Hetty; the gells are both at the cheese.""        After the ale had been drawn and her uncle's pipe lighted, there    was Totty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-    gown because she would cry instead of going to sleep.  Then there    was supper to be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in the    way to give help.  Adam stayed till he knew Mrs. Poyser expected    him to go, engaging her and her husband in talk as constantly as    he could, for the sake of leaving Hetty more at ease.  He    lingered, because he wanted to see her safely through that    evening, and he was delighted to find how much self-command she    showed.  He knew she had not had time to read the letter, but he    did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the letter    would contradict everything he had said.  It was hard work for him    to leave her--hard to think that he should not know for days how    she was bearing her trouble.  But he must go at last, and all he    could do was to press her hand gently as he said ""Good-bye,"" and    hope she would take that as a sign that if his love could ever be    a refuge for her, it was there the same as ever.  How busy his    thoughts were, as he walked home, in devising pitying excuses for    her folly, in referring all her weakness to the sweet lovingness    of her nature, in blaming Arthur, with less and less inclination    to admit that his conduct might be extenuated too!  His    exasperation at Hetty's suffering--and also at the sense that she    was possibly thrust for ever out of his own reach--deafened him to    any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought this misery.     Adam was a clear-sighted, fair-minded man--a fine fellow, indeed,    morally as well as physically.  But if Aristides the Just was ever    in love and jealous, he was at that moment not perfectly    magnanimous.  And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful    days, felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity.  He    was bitterly jealous, and in proportion as his love made him    indulgent in his judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in    his feeling towards Arthur.        ""Her head was allays likely to be turned,"" he thought, ""when a    gentleman, with his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white    hands, and that way o' talking gentlefolks have, came about her,    making up to her in a bold way, as a man couldn't do that was only    her equal; and it's much if she'll ever like a common man now.""     He could not help drawing his own hands out of his pocket and    looking at them--at the hard palms and the broken finger-nails.     ""I'm a roughish fellow, altogether; I don't know, now I come to    think on't, what there is much for a woman to like about me; and    yet I might ha' got another wife easy enough, if I hadn't set my    heart on her.  But it's little matter what other women think about    me, if she can't love me.  She might ha' loved me, perhaps, as    likely as any other man--there's nobody hereabouts as I'm afraid    of, if he hadn't come between us; but now I shall belike be    hateful to her because I'm so different to him.  And yet there's    no telling--she may turn round the other way, when she finds he's    made light of her all the while.  She may come to feel the vally    of a man as 'ud be thankful to be bound to her all his life.  But    I must put up with it whichever way it is--I've only to be    thankful it's been no worse.  I am not th' only man that's got to    do without much happiness i' this life.  There's many a good bit    o' work done with a bad heart.  It's God's will, and that's enough    for us: we shouldn't know better how things ought to be than He    does, I reckon, if we was to spend our lives i' puzzling.  But it    'ud ha' gone near to spoil my work for me, if I'd seen her brought    to sorrow and shame, and through the man as I've always been proud    to think on.  Since I've been spared that, I've no right to    grumble.  When a man's got his limbs whole, he can bear a smart    cut or two.""        As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections,    he perceived a man walking along the field before him.  He knew it    was Seth, returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to    overtake him.        ""I thought thee'dst be at home before me,"" he said, as Seth turned    round to wait for him, ""for I'm later than usual to-night.""        ""Well, I'm later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with    John Barnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of    perfection, and I'd a question to ask him about his experience.     It's one o' them subjects that lead you further than y' expect--    they don't lie along the straight road.""        They walked along together in silence two or three minutes.  Adam    was not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious    experience, but he was inclined to interchange a word or two of    brotherly affection and confidence with Seth.  That was a rare    impulse in him, much as the brothers loved each other.  They    hardly ever spoke of personal matters, or uttered more than an    allusion to their family troubles.  Adam was by nature reserved in    all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain timidity towards    his more practical brother.        ""Seth, lad,"" Adam said, putting his arm on his brother's shoulder,    ""hast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?""        ""Yes,"" said Seth.  ""She told me I might write her word after a    while, how we went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble.     So I wrote to her a fortnight ago, and told her about thee having    a new employment, and how Mother was more contented; and last    Wednesday, when I called at the post at Treddles'on, I found a    letter from her.  I think thee'dst perhaps like to read it, but I    didna say anything about it because thee'st seemed so full of    other things.  It's quite easy t' read--she writes wonderful for a    woman.""        Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam,    who said, as he took it, ""Aye, lad, I've got a tough load to carry    just now--thee mustna take it ill if I'm a bit silenter and    crustier nor usual.  Trouble doesna make me care the less for    thee.  I know we shall stick together to the last.""        ""I take nought ill o' thee, Adam.  I know well enough what it    means if thee't a bit short wi' me now and then.""        ""There's Mother opening the door to look out for us,"" said Adam,    as they mounted the slope.  ""She's been sitting i' the dark as    usual.  Well, Gyp, well, art glad to see me?""        Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she had    heard the welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gyp's    joyful bark.        ""Eh, my lads!  Th' hours war ne'er so long sin' I war born as    they'n been this blessed Sunday night.  What can ye both ha' been    doin' till this time?""        ""Thee shouldstna sit i' the dark, Mother,"" said Adam; ""that makes    the time seem longer.""        ""Eh, what am I to do wi' burnin' candle of a Sunday, when there's    on'y me an' it's sin to do a bit o' knittin'?  The daylight's long    enough for me to stare i' the booke as I canna read.  It 'ud be a    fine way o' shortenin' the time, to make it waste the good candle.     But which on you's for ha'in' supper?  Ye mun ayther be clemmed or    full, I should think, seein' what time o' night it is.""        ""I'm hungry, Mother,"" said Seth, seating himself at the little    table, which had been spread ever since it was light.        ""I've had my supper,"" said Adam.  ""Here, Gyp,"" he added, taking    some cold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey head    that looked up towards him.        ""Thee needstna be gi'in' th' dog,"" said Lisbeth; ""I'n fed him well    a'ready.  I'm not like to forget him, I reckon, when he's all o'    thee I can get sight on.""        ""Come, then, Gyp,"" said Adam, ""we'll go to bed.  Good-night,    Mother; I'm very tired.""        ""What ails him, dost know?"" Lisbeth said to Seth, when Adam was    gone upstairs.  ""He's like as if he was struck for death this day    or two--he's so cast down.  I found him i' the shop this forenoon,    arter thee wast gone, a-sittin' an' doin' nothin'--not so much as    a booke afore him.""        ""He's a deal o' work upon him just now, Mother,"" said Seth, ""and I    think he's a bit troubled in his mind.  Don't you take notice of    it, because it hurts him when you do.  Be as kind to him as you    can, Mother, and don't say anything to vex him.""        ""Eh, what dost talk o' my vexin' him?  An' what am I like to be    but kind?  I'll ma' him a kettle-cake for breakfast i' the    mornin'.""        Adam, meanwhile, was reading Dinah's letter by the light of his    dip candle.                DEAR BROTHER SETH--Your letter lay three days beyond my knowing of    it at the post, for I had not money enough by me to pay the    carriage, this being a time of great need and sickness here, with    the rains that have fallen, as if the windows of heaven were    opened again; and to lay by money, from day to day, in such a    time, when there are so many in present need of all things, would    be a want of trust like the laying up of the manna.  I speak of    this, because I would not have you think me slow to answer, or    that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly good that    has befallen your brother Adam.  The honour and love you bear him    is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts, and he    uses them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted to    a place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards    his parent and his younger brother.        ""My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to    be near her in the day of trouble.  Speak to her of me, and tell    her I often bear her in my thoughts at evening time, when I am    sitting in the dim light as I did with her, and we held one    another's hands, and I spoke the words of comfort that were given    to me.  Ah, that is a blessed time, isn't it, Seth, when the    outward light is fading, and the body is a little wearied with its    work and its labour.  Then the inward light shines the brighter,    and we have a deeper sense of resting on the Divine strength.  I    sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes, and it is as    if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore.  For    then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the blindness, and    the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep over--yea, all the    anguish of the children of men, which sometimes wraps me round    like sudden darkness--I can bear with a willing pain, as if I was    sharing the Redeemer's cross.  For I feel it, I feel it--infinite    love is suffering too--yea, in the fulness of knowledge it    suffers, it yearns, it mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking    which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith the whole    creation groaneth and travaileth.  Surely it is not true    blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow and sin    in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does not    seek to throw it off.  It is not the spirit only that tells me    this--I see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel.  Is there    not pleading in heaven?  Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that    crucified body wherewith he ascended?  And is He not one with the    Infinite Love itself--as our love is one with our sorrow?        ""These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have    seen with new clearness the meaning of those words, 'If any man    love me, let him take up my cross.'  I have heard this enlarged on    as if it meant the troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves    by confessing Jesus.  But surely that is a narrow thought.  The    true cross of the Redeemer was the sin and sorrow of this world--    that was what lay heavy on his heart--and that is the cross we    shall share with him, that is the cup we must drink of with him,    if we would have any part in that Divine Love which is one with    his sorrow.        ""In my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and    abound.  I have had constant work in the mill, though some of the    other hands have been turned off for a time, and my body is    greatly strengthened, so that I feel little weariness after long    walking and speaking.  What you say about staying in your own    country with your mother and brother shows me that you have a true    guidance; your lot is appointed there by a clear showing, and to    seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a false    offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle    it.  My work and my joy are here among the hills, and I sometimes    think I cling too much to my life among the people here, and    should be rebellious if I was called away.        ""I was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the    Hall Farm, for though I sent them a letter, by my aunt's desire,    after I came back from my sojourn among them, I have had no word    from them.  My aunt has not the pen of a ready writer, and the    work of the house is sufficient for the day, for she is weak in    body.  My heart cleaves to her and her children as the nearest of    all to me in the flesh--yea, and to all in that house.  I am    carried away to them continually in my sleep, and often in the    midst of work, and even of speech, the thought of them is borne in    on me as if they were in need and trouble, which yet is dark to    me.  There may be some leading here; but I wait to be taught.  You    say they are all well.        ""We shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it    may be, not for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at    Leeds are desirous to have me for a short space among them, when I    have a door opened me again to leave Snowfield.        ""Farewell, dear brother--and yet not farewell.  For those children    of God whom it has been granted to see each other face to face,    and to hold communion together, and to feel the same spirit    working in both can never more be sundered though the hills may    lie between.  For their souls are enlarged for evermore by that    union, and they bear one another about in their thoughts    continually as it were a new strength.--Your faithful Sister and    fellow-worker in Christ,        DINAH MORRIS.""            ""I have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen    moves slow.  And so I am straitened, and say but little of what is    in my mind.  Greet your mother for me with a kiss.  She asked me    to kiss her twice when we parted.""            Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with    his head resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came    upstairs.        ""Hast read the letter?"" said Seth.        ""Yes,"" said Adam.  ""I don't know what I should ha' thought of her    and her letter if I'd never seen her: I daresay I should ha'    thought a preaching woman hateful.  But she's one as makes    everything seem right she says and does, and I seemed to see her    and hear her speaking when I read the letter.  It's wonderful how    I remember her looks and her voice.  She'd make thee rare and    happy, Seth; she's just the woman for thee.""        ""It's no use thinking o' that,"" said Seth, despondingly.  ""She    spoke so firm, and she's not the woman to say one thing and mean    another.""        ""Nay, but her feelings may grow different.  A woman may get to    love by degrees--the best fire dosna flare up the soonest.  I'd    have thee go and see her by and by: I'd make it convenient for    thee to be away three or four days, and it 'ud be no walk for    thee--only between twenty and thirty mile.""        ""I should like to see her again, whether or no, if she wouldna be    displeased with me for going,"" said Seth.        ""She'll be none displeased,"" said Adam emphatically, getting up    and throwing off his coat.  ""It might be a great happiness to us    all if she'd have thee, for mother took to her so wonderful and    seemed so contented to be with her.""        ""Aye,"" said Seth, rather timidly, ""and Dinah's fond o' Hetty too;    she thinks a deal about her.""        Adam made no reply to that, and no other word but ""good-night""    passed between them.  "
964,The Theory Of Moral Sentiments,1,Adam Smith  ,Part07,"CHAPTER X - THE RIVER                'Are you fond of the water?' is a question very frequently asked,    in hot summer weather, by amphibious-looking young men.  'Very,' is    the general reply.  'An't you?' - 'Hardly ever off it,' is the    response, accompanied by sundry adjectives, expressive of the    speaker's heartfelt admiration of that element.  Now, with all    respect for the opinion of society in general, and cutter clubs in    particular, we humbly suggest that some of the most painful    reminiscences in the mind of every individual who has occasionally    disported himself on the Thames, must be connected with his aquatic    recreations.  Who ever heard of a successful water-party? - or to    put the question in a still more intelligible form, who ever saw    one?  We have been on water excursions out of number, but we    solemnly declare that we cannot call to mind one single occasion of    the kind, which was not marked by more miseries than any one would    suppose could be reasonably crowded into the space of some eight or    nine hours.  Something has always gone wrong.  Either the cork of    the salad-dressing has come out, or the most anxiously expected    member of the party has not come out, or the most disagreeable man    in company would come out, or a child or two have fallen into the    water, or the gentleman who undertook to steer has endangered    everybody's life all the way, or the gentlemen who volunteered to    row have been 'out of practice,' and performed very alarming    evolutions, putting their oars down into the water and not being    able to get them up again, or taking terrific pulls without putting    them in at all; in either case, pitching over on the backs of their    heads with startling violence, and exhibiting the soles of their    pumps to the 'sitters' in the boat, in a very humiliating manner.        We grant that the banks of the Thames are very beautiful at    Richmond and Twickenham, and other distant havens, often sought    though seldom reached; but from the 'Red-us' back to Blackfriars-    bridge, the scene is wonderfully changed.  The Penitentiary is a    noble building, no doubt, and the sportive youths who 'go in' at    that particular part of the river, on a summer's evening, may be    all very well in perspective; but when you are obliged to keep in    shore coming home, and the young ladies will colour up, and look    perseveringly the other way, while the married dittos cough    slightly, and stare very hard at the water, you feel awkward -    especially if you happen to have been attempting the most distant    approach to sentimentality, for an hour or two previously.        Although experience and suffering have produced in our minds the    result we have just stated, we are by no means blind to a proper    sense of the fun which a looker-on may extract from the amateurs of    boating.  What can be more amusing than Searle's yard on a fine    Sunday morning?  It's a Richmond tide, and some dozen boats are    preparing for the reception of the parties who have engaged them.    Two or three fellows in great rough trousers and Guernsey shirts,    are getting them ready by easy stages; now coming down the yard    with a pair of sculls and a cushion - then having a chat with the    'Jack,' who, like all his tribe, seems to be wholly incapable of    doing anything but lounging about - then going back again, and    returning with a rudder-line and a stretcher - then solacing    themselves with another chat - and then wondering, with their hands    in their capacious pockets, 'where them gentlemen's got to as    ordered the six.'  One of these, the head man, with the legs of his    trousers carefully tucked up at the bottom, to admit the water, we    presume - for it is an element in which he is infinitely more at    home than on land - is quite a character, and shares with the    defunct oyster-swallower the celebrated name of 'Dando.'  Watch    him, as taking a few minutes' respite from his toils, he    negligently seats himself on the edge of a boat, and fans his broad    bushy chest with a cap scarcely half so furry.  Look at his    magnificent, though reddish whiskers, and mark the somewhat native    humour with which he 'chaffs' the boys and 'prentices, or cunningly    gammons the gen'lm'n into the gift of a glass of gin, of which we    verily believe he swallows in one day as much as any six ordinary    men, without ever being one atom the worse for it.        But the party arrives, and Dando, relieved from his state of    uncertainty, starts up into activity.  They approach in full    aquatic costume, with round blue jackets, striped shirts, and caps    of all sizes and patterns, from the velvet skull-cap of French    manufacture, to the easy head-dress familiar to the students of the    old spelling-books, as having, on the authority of the portrait,    formed part of the costume of the Reverend Mr. Dilworth.        This is the most amusing time to observe a regular Sunday water-    party.  There has evidently been up to this period no    inconsiderable degree of boasting on everybody's part relative to    his knowledge of navigation; the sight of the water rapidly cools    their courage, and the air of self-denial with which each of them    insists on somebody else's taking an oar, is perfectly delightful.    At length, after a great deal of changing and fidgeting, consequent    upon the election of a stroke-oar:  the inability of one gentleman    to pull on this side, of another to pull on that, and of a third to    pull at all, the boat's crew are seated.  'Shove her off!' cries    the cockswain, who looks as easy and comfortable as if he were    steering in the Bay of Biscay.  The order is obeyed; the boat is    immediately turned completely round, and proceeds towards    Westminster-bridge, amidst such a splashing and struggling as never    was seen before, except when the Royal George went down.  'Back    wa'ater, sir,' shouts Dando, 'Back wa'ater, you sir, aft;' upon    which everybody thinking he must be the individual referred to,    they all back water, and back comes the boat, stern first, to the    spot whence it started.  'Back water, you sir, aft; pull round, you    sir, for'ad, can't you?' shouts Dando, in a frenzy of excitement.    'Pull round, Tom, can't you?' re-echoes one of the party.  'Tom    an't for'ad,' replies another.  'Yes, he is,' cries a third; and    the unfortunate young man, at the imminent risk of breaking a    blood-vessel, pulls and pulls, until the head of the boat fairly    lies in the direction of Vauxhall-bridge.  'That's right - now pull    all on you!' shouts Dando again, adding, in an under-tone, to    somebody by him, 'Blowed if hever I see sich a set of muffs!' and    away jogs the boat in a zigzag direction, every one of the six oars    dipping into the water at a different time; and the yard is once    more clear, until the arrival of the next party.        A well-contested rowing-match on the Thames, is a very lively and    interesting scene.  The water is studded with boats of all sorts,    kinds, and descriptions; places in the coal-barges at the different    wharfs are let to crowds of spectators, beer and tobacco flow    freely about; men, women, and children wait for the start in    breathless expectation; cutters of six and eight oars glide gently    up and down, waiting to accompany their PROTEGES during the race;    bands of music add to the animation, if not to the harmony of the    scene; groups of watermen are assembled at the different stairs,    discussing the merits of the respective candidates; and the prize    wherry, which is rowed slowly about by a pair of sculls, is an    object of general interest.        Two o'clock strikes, and everybody looks anxiously in the direction    of the bridge through which the candidates for the prize will come    - half-past two, and the general attention which has been preserved    so long begins to flag, when suddenly a gun is heard, and a noise    of distant hurra'ing along each bank of the river - every head is    bent forward - the noise draws nearer and nearer - the boats which    have been waiting at the bridge start briskly up the river, and a    well-manned galley shoots through the arch, the sitters cheering on    the boats behind them, which are not yet visible.        'Here they are,' is the general cry - and through darts the first    boat, the men in her, stripped to the skin, and exerting every    muscle to preserve the advantage they have gained - four other    boats follow close astern; there are not two boats' length between    them - the shouting is tremendous, and the interest intense.  'Go    on, Pink' - 'Give it her, Red' - 'Sulliwin for ever' - 'Bravo!    George' - 'Now, Tom, now - now - now - why don't your partner    stretch out?' - 'Two pots to a pint on Yellow,' &c., &c.  Every    little public-house fires its gun, and hoists its flag; and the men    who win the heat, come in, amidst a splashing and shouting, and    banging and confusion, which no one can imagine who has not    witnessed it, and of which any description would convey a very    faint idea.        One of the most amusing places we know is the steam-wharf of the    London Bridge, or St. Katharine's Dock Company, on a Saturday    morning in summer, when the Gravesend and Margate steamers are    usually crowded to excess; and as we have just taken a glance at    the river above bridge, we hope our readers will not object to    accompany us on board a Gravesend packet.        Coaches are every moment setting down at the entrance to the wharf,    and the stare of bewildered astonishment with which the 'fares'    resign themselves and their luggage into the hands of the porters,    who seize all the packages at once as a matter of course, and run    away with them, heaven knows where, is laughable in the extreme.  A    Margate boat lies alongside the wharf, the Gravesend boat (which    starts first) lies alongside that again; and as a temporary    communication is formed between the two, by means of a plank and    hand-rail, the natural confusion of the scene is by no means    diminished.        'Gravesend?' inquires a stout father of a stout family, who follow    him, under the guidance of their mother, and a servant, at the no    small risk of two or three of them being left behind in the    confusion.  'Gravesend?'        'Pass on, if you please, sir,' replies the attendant - 'other boat,    sir.'        Hereupon the stout father, being rather mystified, and the stout    mother rather distracted by maternal anxiety, the whole party    deposit themselves in the Margate boat, and after having    congratulated himself on having secured very comfortable seats, the    stout father sallies to the chimney to look for his luggage, which    he has a faint recollection of having given some man, something, to    take somewhere.  No luggage, however, bearing the most remote    resemblance to his own, in shape or form, is to be discovered; on    which the stout father calls very loudly for an officer, to whom he    states the case, in the presence of another father of another    family - a little thin man - who entirely concurs with him (the    stout father) in thinking that it's high time something was done    with these steam companies, and that as the Corporation Bill failed    to do it, something else must; for really people's property is not    to be sacrificed in this way; and that if the luggage isn't    restored without delay, he will take care it shall be put in the    papers, for the public is not to be the victim of these great    monopolies.  To this, the officer, in his turn, replies, that that    company, ever since it has been St. Kat'rine's Dock Company, has    protected life and property; that if it had been the London Bridge    Wharf Company, indeed, he shouldn't have wondered, seeing that the    morality of that company (they being the opposition) can't be    answered for, by no one; but as it is, he's convinced there must be    some mistake, and he wouldn't mind making a solemn oath afore a    magistrate that the gentleman'll find his luggage afore he gets to    Margate.        Here the stout father, thinking he is making a capital point,    replies, that as it happens, he is not going to Margate at all, and    that 'Passenger to Gravesend' was on the luggage, in letters of    full two inches long; on which the officer rapidly explains the    mistake, and the stout mother, and the stout children, and the    servant, are hurried with all possible despatch on board the    Gravesend boat, which they reached just in time to discover that    their luggage is there, and that their comfortable seats are not.    Then the bell, which is the signal for the Gravesend boat starting,    begins to ring most furiously:  and people keep time to the bell,    by running in and out of our boat at a double-quick pace.  The bell    stops; the boat starts:  people who have been taking leave of their    friends on board, are carried away against their will; and people    who have been taking leave of their friends on shore, find that    they have performed a very needless ceremony, in consequence of    their not being carried away at all.  The regular passengers, who    have season tickets, go below to breakfast; people who have    purchased morning papers, compose themselves to read them; and    people who have not been down the river before, think that both the    shipping and the water, look a great deal better at a distance.        When we get down about as far as Blackwall, and begin to move at a    quicker rate, the spirits of the passengers appear to rise in    proportion.  Old women who have brought large wicker hand-baskets    with them, set seriously to work at the demolition of heavy    sandwiches, and pass round a wine-glass, which is frequently    replenished from a flat bottle like a stomach-warmer, with    considerable glee:  handing it first to the gentleman in the    foraging-cap, who plays the harp - partly as an expression of    satisfaction with his previous exertions, and partly to induce him    to play 'Dumbledumbdeary,' for 'Alick' to dance to; which being    done, Alick, who is a damp earthy child in red worsted socks, takes    certain small jumps upon the deck, to the unspeakable satisfaction    of his family circle.  Girls who have brought the first volume of    some new novel in their reticule, become extremely plaintive, and    expatiate to Mr. Brown, or young Mr. O'Brien, who has been looking    over them, on the blueness of the sky, and brightness of the water;    on which Mr. Brown or Mr. O'Brien, as the case may be, remarks in a    low voice that he has been quite insensible of late to the beauties    of nature, that his whole thoughts and wishes have centred in one    object alone - whereupon the young lady looks up, and failing in    her attempt to appear unconscious, looks down again; and turns over    the next leaf with great difficulty, in order to afford opportunity    for a lengthened pressure of the hand.        Telescopes, sandwiches, and glasses of brandy-and-water cold    without, begin to be in great requisition; and bashful men who have    been looking down the hatchway at the engine, find, to their great    relief, a subject on which they can converse with one another - and    a copious one too - Steam.        'Wonderful thing steam, sir.'  'Ah! (a deep-drawn sigh) it is    indeed, sir.'  'Great power, sir.'  'Immense - immense!'  'Great    deal done by steam, sir.'  'Ah! (another sigh at the immensity of    the subject, and a knowing shake of the head) you may say that,    sir.'  'Still in its infancy, they say, sir.'  Novel remarks of    this kind, are generally the commencement of a conversation which    is prolonged until the conclusion of the trip, and, perhaps, lays    the foundation of a speaking acquaintance between half-a-dozen    gentlemen, who, having their families at Gravesend, take season    tickets for the boat, and dine on board regularly every afternoon.

1033,Travels And Researches In South Africa,55,David Livingstone,Chapter12,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea      	by Jules Verne              PART ONE          CHAPTER I        A SHIFTING REEF        The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious    and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.    Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population    and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents,    seafaring men were particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors,    captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America,    naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States    on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.        For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,""    a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent,    and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.        The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)    agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question,    the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion,    and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.  If it was a whale,    it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science.    Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times--    rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object    a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions    which set it down as a mile in width and three in length--we might fairly    conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions    admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all.    And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency    which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand    the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition.    As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question.        On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson,    of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met    this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia.    Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an    unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position    when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object,    shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air.    Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent    eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither    more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then,    which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with    air and vapour.        Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year,    in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India    and Pacific Steam Navigation Company.  But this extraordinary    creature could transport itself from one place to another    with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days,    the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at    two different points of the chart, separated by a distance    of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.        Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the Helvetia,    of the Compagnie-Nationale, and the Shannon, of the Royal    Mail Steamship Company, sailing to windward in that portion    of the Atlantic lying between the United States and Europe,    respectively signalled the monster to each other in 42@ 15' N. lat.    and 60@ 35' W. long.  In these simultaneous observations they    thought themselves justified in estimating the minimum length    of the mammal at more than three hundred and fifty feet,    as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions than it,    though they measured three hundred feet over all.        Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea round    the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never exceeded the length    of sixty yards, if they attain that.        In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion.    They sang of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented    it on the stage.  All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it.    There appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and    imaginary creature, from the white whale, the terrible ""Moby Dick""    of sub-arctic regions, to the immense kraken, whose tentacles could entangle    a ship of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean.    The legends of ancient times were even revived.        Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the    unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals.    ""The question of the monster"" inflamed all minds.  Editors of    scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,    spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing blood;    for from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.        During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,    never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public.    It was then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real    danger seriously to be avoided.  The question took quite another shape.    The monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite    and shifting proportions.        On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,    finding herself during the night in 27@ 30' lat.  and 72@ 15' long., struck    on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for that part of the sea.    Under the combined efforts of the wind and its four hundred horse power,    it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.  Had it not been for the superior    strength of the hull of the Moravian, she would have been broken by the shock    and gone down with the 237 passengers she was bringing home from Canada.        The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day    was breaking.  The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part    of the vessel.  They examined the sea with the most careful attention.    They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables' length distant,    as if the surface had been violently agitated.  The bearings of the place were    taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without apparent damage.    Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous wreck?  They could    not tell; but, on examination of the ship's bottom when undergoing repairs,    it was found that part of her keel was broken.        This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten    like many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted    under similar circumstances.  But, thanks to the nationality of    the victim of the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to    which the vessel belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.        The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze favourable,    the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's line, found herself in 15@ 12' long.    and 45@ 37' lat.  She was going at the speed of thirteen knots and a half.        At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers were    assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on the hull    of the Scotia, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.        The Scotia had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly    by something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt.    The shock had been so slight that no one had been alarmed,    had it not been for the shouts of the carpenter's watch,    who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, ""We are sinking! we    are sinking!""  At first the passengers were much frightened,    but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.  The danger could    not be imminent.  The Scotia, divided into seven compartments    by strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak.    Captain Anderson went down immediately into the hold.    He found that the sea was pouring into the fifth compartment;    and the rapidity of the influx proved that the force of the water    was considerable.  Fortunately this compartment did not hold    the boilers, or the fires would have been immediately extinguished.    Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at once,    and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the injury.    Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a    large hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's bottom.    Such a leak could not be stopped; and the Scotia, her paddles    half submerged, was obliged to continue her course.  She was then    three hundred miles from Cape Clear, and, after three days' delay,    which caused great uneasiness in Liverpool, she entered the basin    of the company.        The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry dock.    They could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below    water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.    The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined    that it could not have been more neatly done by a punch.    It was clear, then, that the instrument producing the perforation    was not of a common stamp and, after having been driven with    prodigious strength, and piercing an iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick,    had withdrawn itself by a backward motion.        Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the torrent    of public opinion.  From this moment all unlucky casualties which could    not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster.        Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all    these shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable;    for of three thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded    at Lloyd's, the number of sailing and steam-ships supposed    to be totally lost, from the absence of all news, amounted to    not less than two hundred!        Now, it was the ""monster"" who, justly or unjustly, was accused    of their disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between    the different continents became more and more dangerous.    The public demanded sharply that the seas should at any price be    relieved from this formidable cetacean.  [1]        [1] Member of the whale family.    "

There are circumstances in which, whether you partake of the    tea or not- some people of course never do- the situation is in itself    delightful. Those that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this    simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime.    The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn    of an old English country-house, in what I should call the perfect    middle of a splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had    waned, but much of it was left, and what was left was of the finest    and rarest quality. Real dusk would not arrive for many hours; but the    flood of summer light had begun to ebb, the air had grown mellow,    the shadows were long upon the smooth, dense turf. They lengthened    slowly, however, and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still    to come which is perhaps the chief source of one's enjoyment of such a    scene at such an hour. From five o'clock to eight is on certain    occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the    interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons    concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were    not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of    the ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect lawn were    straight and angular; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a    deep wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served,    and of two younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in    front of him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an unusually    large cup, of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted    in brilliant colours. He disposed of its contents with much    circumspection, holding it for a long time close to his chin, with his    face turned to the house. His companions had either finished their tea    or were indifferent to their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as they    continued to stroll. One of them, from time to time, as he passed,    looked with a certain attention at the elder man, who, unconscious    of observation, rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his    dwelling. The house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay    such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the    peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch.      It stood upon a low hill, above the river- the river being the    Thames at some forty miles from London. A long gabled front of red    brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played    all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine    it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered    chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The house had a name    and a history; the old gentleman taking his tea would have been    delighted to tell you these things: how it had been built under Edward    the Sixth, had offered a night's hospitality to the great Elizabeth    (whose august person had extended itself upon a huge, magnificent, and    terribly angular bed which still formed the principal honour of the    sleeping apartments), had been a good deal bruised and defaced in    Cromwell's wars, and then, under the Restoration, repaired and much    enlarged; and how, finally, after having been remodelled and    disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed into the careful    keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it originally    because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth) it was    offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its    ugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of    twenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it,    so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to    stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of    its various protuberances- which fell so softly upon the warm, weary    brickwork- were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said, he    could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants,    several of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an    undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was    not the least honourable. The front of the house overlooking that    portion of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the    entrance-front; this was in quite another quarter. Privacy here    reigned supreme, and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level    hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior. The great    still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet    curtains; and the place was furnished, like a room, with cushioned    seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with the books and papers that lay    upon the grass. The river was at some distance; where the ground began    to slope, the lawn, properly speaking, ceased. But it was none the    less a charming walk down to the water.      The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty    years before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his    American physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but    he had kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have    taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At    present, obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace    himself; his journeys were over, and he was taking the rest that    precedes the great rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with    features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness.    It was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not    large, so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a    merit. It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life, yet it    seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and    invidious, but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure. He    had certainly had a great experience of men, but there was an almost    rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean,    spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at last slowly    and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the table. He was    neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was folded upon his    knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered slippers. A    beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the    master's face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still    more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling,    bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other    gentlemen.      One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with    a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched    was something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair    and frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the    rich adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain    fortunate, brilliant exceptional look- the air of a happy    temperament fertilized by a high civilization- which would have made    almost any observer envy him at a venture. He was booted and    spurred, as if he had dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white    hat, which looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind him,    and in one of them- a large, white, well-shaped fist- was crumpled a    pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.      His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a    person of quite a different pattern, who, although he might have    excited grave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked    you to wish yourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean,    loosely and feebly put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty,    charming face, furnished, but by no means decorated, with a straggling    moustache and whisker. He looked clever and ill- a combination by no    means felicitous; and he wore a brown velvet jacket. He carried his    hands in his pockets, and there was something in the way he did it    that showed the habit was inveterate. His gait had a shambling,    wandering quality; he was not very firm on his legs. As I have said,    whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his eyes upon    him; and at this moment, with their faces brought into relation, you    would easily have seen they were father and son. The father caught his    son's eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive smile.      ""I'm getting on very well,"" he said.      ""Have you drunk your tea?"" asked the son.      ""Yes, and enjoyed it.""      ""Shall I give you some more?""      The old man considered, placidly. ""Well, I guess I'll wait and see.""    He had, in speaking, the American tone.      ""Are you cold?"" the son enquired.      The father slowly rubbed his legs. ""Well, I don't know. I can't tell    till I feel.""      ""Perhaps some one might feel for you,"" said the younger man,    laughing.      ""Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don't you feel for me,    Lord Warburton?""      ""Oh yes, immensely,"" said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton,    promptly. ""I'm bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable.""      ""Well, I suppose I am, in most respects."" And the old man looked    down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. ""The fact is    I've been comfortable so many years that I suppose I've got so used to    it I don't know it.""      ""Yes, that's the bore of comfort,"" said Lord Warburton. ""We only    know when we're uncomfortable.""      ""It strikes me we're rather particular,"" his companion remarked.      ""Oh yes, there's no doubt we're particular,"" Lord Warburton    murmured. And then the three men remained silent a while; the two    younger ones standing looking down at the other, who presently asked    for more tea. ""I should think you would be very unhappy with that    shawl,"" Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the old    man's cup again.      ""Oh no, he must have the shawl!"" cried the gentleman in the velvet    coat. ""Don't put such ideas as that into his head.""      ""It belongs to my wife,"" said the old man simply.      ""Oh, if it's for sentimental reasons-"" And Lord Warburton made a    gesture of apology.      ""I suppose I must give it to her when she comes,"" the old man went    on.      ""You'll please to do nothing of the kind. You'll keep it to cover    your poor old legs.""      ""Well, you mustn't abuse my legs,"" said the old man. ""I guess they    are as good as yours.""      ""Oh, you're perfectly free to abuse mine,"" his son replied, giving    him his tea.      ""Well, we're two lame ducks; I don't think there's much difference.""      ""I'm much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How's your tea?""      ""Well, it's rather hot.""      ""That's intended to be a merit.""      ""Ah, there's a great deal of merit,"" murmured the old man, kindly.    ""He's a very good nurse, Lord Warburton.""      ""Isn't he a bit clumsy?"" asked his lordship.      ""Oh no, he's not clumsy- considering that he's an invalid himself.    He's a very good nurse- for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse    because he's sick himself.""      ""Oh, come, daddy!"" the ugly young man exclaimed.      ""Well, you are; I wish you weren't. But I suppose you can't help    it.""      ""I might try: that's an idea,"" said the young man.      ""Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?"" his father asked.      Lord Warburton considered a moment. ""Yes, sir, once, in the    Persian Gulf.""      He's making light of you, daddy,"" said the other young man.    ""That's a sort of joke.""      ""Well, there seem to be so many sorts now,"" daddy replied, serenely.    ""You don't look as if you had been sick, any way, Lord Warburton.""      ""He's sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully    about it,"" said Lord Warburton's friend.      ""Is that true, sir?"" asked the old man gravely.      ""If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He's a wretched fellow    to talk to- a regular cynic. He doesn't seem to believe in anything.""      ""That's another sort of joke,"" said the person accused of cynicism.      ""It's because his health is so poor,"" his father explained to Lord    Warburton. ""It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at    things; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it's    almost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn't seem to affect his    spirits. I've hardly ever seen him when he wasn't cheerful- about as    he is at present. He often cheers me up.""      The young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. ""Is    it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me    to carry out my theories, daddy?""      ""By Jove, we should see some queer things!"" cried Lord Warburton.      ""I hope you haven't taken up that sort of tone,"" said the old man.      ""Warburton's tone is worse than mine; he pretends to be bored. I'm    not in the least bored; I find life only too interesting.""      ""Ah, too interesting; you shouldn't allow it to be that, you know!""      ""I'm never bored when I come here,"" said Lord Warburton. ""One gets    such uncommonly good talk.""      ""Is that another sort of joke?"" asked the old man. ""You've no excuse    for being bored anywhere. When I was your age I had never heard of    such a thing.""      ""You must have developed very late.""      ""No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason. When I was    twenty years old I was very highly developed indeed. I was working    tooth and nail. You wouldn't be bored if you had something to do;    but all you young men are too idle. You think too much of your    pleasure. You're too fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich.""      ""Oh, I say,"" cried Lord Warburton, ""you're hardly the person to    accuse a fellow-creature of being too rich!""      ""Do you mean because I'm a banker?"" asked the old man.      ""Because of that, if you like; and because you have- haven't you?-    such unlimited means.""      ""He isn't very rich,"" the other young man mercifully pleaded. ""He    has given away an immense deal of money.""      ""Well, I suppose it was his own,"" said Lord Warburton; ""and in    that case could there be a better proof of wealth? Let not a public    benefactor talk of one's being too fond of pleasure.""      ""Daddy's very fond of pleasure- of other people's.""      The old man shook his head. ""I don't pretend to have contributed    anything to the amusement of my contemporaries.""      ""My dear father, you're too modest!""      ""That's a kind of joke, sir,"" said Lord Warburton.      ""You young men have too many jokes. When there are no jokes you've    nothing left.""      ""Fortunately there are always more jokes,"" the ugly young man    remarked.      ""I don't believe it- I believe things are getting more serious.    You young men will find that out.""      ""The increasing seriousness of things, then- that's the great    opportunity of jokes.""      ""They'll have to be grim jokes,"" said the old man. ""I'm convinced    there will be great changes; and not all for the better.""      ""I quite agree with you, sir,"" Lord Warburton declared. ""I'm very    sure there will be great changes, and that all sorts of queer things    will happen. That's why I find so much difficulty in applying your    advice; you know you told me the other day that I ought to 'take hold'    of something. One hesitates to take hold of a thing that may the    next moment be knocked sky-high.""      ""You ought to take hold of a pretty woman,"" said his companion.    ""He's trying hard to fall in love,"" he added, by way of explanation,    to his father.      ""The pretty women themselves may be sent flying!"" Lord Warburton    exclaimed.      ""No, no, they'll be firm,"" the old man rejoined; ""they'll not be    affected by the social and political changes I just referred to.""      ""You mean they won't be abolished? Very well, then, I'll lay my    hands on one as soon as possible and tie her round my neck as a    life-preserver.""      ""The ladies will save us,"" said the old man; ""that is the best of    them will- for I make a difference between them. Make up to a good one    and marry her, and your life will become much more interesting.""      A momentary silence marked perhaps on the part of his auditors a    sense of the magnanimity of this speech, for it was a secret neither    for his son nor for his visitor that his own experiment in matrimony    had not been a happy one. As he said, however, he made a difference;    and these words may have been intended as a confession of personal    error; though of course it was not in place for either of his    companions to remark that apparently the lady of his choice had not    been one of the best.      ""If I marry an interesting woman I shall be interested: is that what    you say?"" Lord Warburton asked. ""I'm not at all keen about marrying-    your son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what an interesting    woman might do with me.""      ""I should like to see your idea of an interesting woman,"" said his    friend.      ""My dear fellow, you can't see ideas- especially such highly    ethereal ones as mine. If I could only see myself- that would be a    great step in advance.""      ""Well, you may fall in love with whomsoever you please; but you    mustn't fall in love with my niece,"" said the old man.      His son broke into a laugh. ""He'll think you mean that as a    provocation! My dear father, you've lived with the English for    thirty years, and you've picked up a good many of the things they say.    But you've never learned the things they don't say!""      ""I say what I please,"" the old man returned with all his serenity.      ""I haven't the honour of knowing your niece,"" Lord Warburton said.    ""I think it's the first time I've heard of her.""      ""She's a niece of my wife's; Mrs. Touchett brings her to England.""      Then young Mr. Touchett explained. ""My mother, you know, has been    spending the winter in America, and we're expecting her back. She    writes that she has discovered a niece and that she has invited her to    come out with her.""      ""I see- very kind of her,"" said Lord Warburton. ""Is the young lady    interesting?""      ""We hardly know more about her than you; my mother has not gone into    details. She chiefly communicates with us by means of telegrams, and    her telegrams are rather inscrutable. They say women don't know how to    write them, but my mother has thoroughly mastered the art of    condensation. 'Tired America, hot weather awful, return England with    niece, first steamer decent cabin.' That's the sort of message we    get from her- that was the last that came. But there had been    another before, which I think contained the first mention of the    niece. 'Changed hotel, very bad, impudent clerk, address here. Taken    sister's girl, died last year, go to Europe, two sisters, quite    independent.' Over that my father and I have scarcely stopped    puzzling; it seems to admit of so many interpretations.""      ""There's one thing very clear in it,"" said the old man; ""she has    given the hotel-clerk a dressing.""      ""I'm not sure even of that, since he has driven her from the    field. We thought at first that the sister mentioned might be the    sister of the clerk; but the subsequent mention of a niece seems to    prove that the allusion is to one of my aunts. There there was a    question as to whose the two other sisters were; they are probably two    of my late aunt's daughters. But who's 'quite independent,' and in    what sense is the term used?- that point's not yet settled. Does the    expression apply more particularly to the young lady my mother has    adopted, or does it characterize her sisters equally?- and is it    used in a moral or in a financial sense? Does it mean that they've    been left well off, or that they wish to be under no obligations? or    does it simply mean that they're fond of their own way?""      ""Whatever else it means, it's pretty sure to mean that,"" Mr.    Touchett remarked.      ""You'll see for yourself,"" said Lord Warburton. ""When does Mrs.    Touchett arrive?""      ""We're quite in the dark; as soon as she can find a decent cabin.    She may be waiting for it yet; on the other hand she may already    have disembarked in England.""      ""In that case she would probably have telegraphed to you.""      ""She never telegraphs when you would expect it- only when you    don't,"" said the old man. ""She likes to drop in on me suddenly; she    thinks she'll find me doing something wrong. She has never done so    yet, but she's not discouraged.""      ""It's her share in the family trait, the independence she speaks    of."" Her son's appreciation of the matter was more favourable.    ""Whatever the high spirit of those young ladies may be, her own is a    match for it. She likes to do everything for herself and has no belief    in any one's power to help her. She thinks me of no more use than a    postage-stamp without gum, and she would never forgive me if I    should presume to go to Liverpool to meet her.""      ""Will you at least let me know when your cousin arrives?"" Lord    Warburton asked.      ""Only on the condition I've mentioned- that you don't fall in love    with her!"" Mr. Touchett replied.      ""That strikes me as hard. Don't you think me good enough?""      ""I think you too good- because I shouldn't like her to marry you.    She hasn't come here to look for a husband, I hope; so many young    ladies are doing that, as if there were no good ones at home. Then    she's probably engaged; American girls are usually engaged, I believe.    Moreover I'm not sure, after all, that you'd be a remarkable husband.""      ""Very likely she's engaged; I've known a good many American girls,    and they always were; but I could never see that it made any    difference, upon my word! As for my being a good husband,"" Mr.    Touchett's visitor pursued, ""I'm not sure of that either. One can    but try!""      ""Try as much as you please, but don't try on my niece,"" smiled the    old man, whose opposition to the idea was broadly humorous.      ""Ah, well,"" said Lord Warburton with a humour broader still,    ""perhaps after all, she's not worth trying on!""    "
1044,Typee,126,Herman Melville ,Chapter30,"No Name, Between the Scenes         BETWEEN THE SCENES. PROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.   I. From Norah Vanstone to Mr. Pendril.  ""Westmoreland House, Kensington,  ""August 14th, 1846.    ""DEAR MR. PENDRIL--The date of this letter will show you that the last  of many hard partings is over. We have left Combe-Raven; we have said farewell  to home.    ""I have been thinking seriously of what you said to me on Wednesday,  before you went back to town. I entirely agree with you that Miss Garth  is more shaken by all she has gone through for our sakes than she is herself  willing to admit; and that it is my duty, for the future, to spare her  all the anxiety that I can on the subject of my sister and myself. This  is very little to do for our dearest friend, for our second mother. Such  as it is, I will do it with all my heart.    ""But, forgive me for saying that I am as far as ever from agreeing with  you about Magdalen. I am so sensible, in our helpless position, of the  importance of your assistance; so anxious to be worthy of the interest  of my father's trusted adviser and oldest friend, that I feel really and  truly disappointed with myself for differing with you--and yet I do differ.  Magdalen is very strange, very unaccountable, to those who don't know her  intimately. I can understand that she has innocently misled you; and that  she has presented herself, perhaps, under her least favorable aspect. But  that the clew to her language and her conduct on Wednesday last is to be  found in such a feeling toward the man who has ruined us, as the feeling  at which you hinted, is what I can not and will not believe of my sister.  If you knew, as I do, what a noble nature she has, you would not be surprised  at this obstinate resistance of mine to your opinion. Will you try to alter  it? I don't mind what Mr. Clare says; he believes in nothing. But I attach  a very serious importance to what you say; and, kind as I know your  motives to be, it distresses me to think you are doing Magdalen an injustice.    ""Having relieved my mind of this confession, I may now come to the proper  object of my letter. I promised, if you could not find leisure time to  visit us to-day, to write and tell you all that happened after you left  us. The day has passed without our seeing you. So I open my writing-case  and perform my promise.    ""I am sorry to say that three of the women-servants--the house-maid,  the kitchen-maid, and even our own maid (to whom I am sure we have always  been kind)--took advantage of your having paid them their wages to pack  up and go as soon as your back was turned. They came to say good-by with  as much ceremony and as little feeling as if they were leaving the house  under ordinary circumstances. The cook, for all her violent temper, behaved  very differently: she sent up a message to say that she would stop and  help us to the last. And Thomas (who has never yet been in any other place  than ours) spoke so gratefully of my dear father's unvarying kindness to  him, and asked so anxiously to be allowed to go on serving us while his  little savings lasted, that Magdalen and I forgot all formal considerations  and both shook hands with him. The poor lad went out of the room crying.  I wish him well; I hope he will find a kind master and a good place.    ""The long, quiet, rainy evening out-of-doors--our last evening at Combe-Raven--was  a sad trial to us. I think winter-time would have weighed less on our spirits;  the drawn curtains and the bright lamps, and the companionable fires would  have helped us. We were only five in the house altogether--after having  once been so many! I can't tell you how dreary the gray daylight looked,  toward seven o'clock, in the lonely rooms, and on the noiseless staircase.  Surely, the prejudice in favor of long summer evenings is the prejudice  of happy people? We did our best. We kept ourselves employed, and Miss  Garth helped us. The prospect of preparing for our departure, which had  seemed so dreadful earlier in the day, altered into the prospect of a refuge  from ourselves as the evening came on. We each tried at first to pack up  in our own rooms--but the loneliness was more than we could bear. We carried  all our possessions downstairs, and heaped them on the large dining-table,  and so made our preparations together in the same room. I am sure we have  taken nothing away which does not properly belong to us.    ""Having already mentioned to you my own conviction that Magdalen was  not herself when you saw her on Wednesday, I feel tempted to stop here  and give you an instance in proof of what I say. The little circumstance  happened on Wednesday night, just before we went up to our rooms.    ""After we had packed our dresses and our birthday presents, our books  and our music, we began to sort our letters, which had got confused from  being placed on the table together. Some of my letters were mixed with  Magdalen's, and some of hers with mine. Among these last I found a card,  which had been given to my sister early in the year by an actor who managed  an amateur theatrical performance in which she took a part. The man had  given her the card, containing his name and address, in the belief that  she would be invited to many more amusements of the same kind, and in the  hope that she would recommend him as a superintendent on future occasions.  I only relate these trifling particulars to show you how little worth keeping  such a card could be, in such circumstances as ours. Naturally enough,  I threw it away from me across the table, meaning to throw it on the floor.  It fell short, close to the place in which Magdalen was sitting. She took  it up, looked at it, and immediately declared that she would not have had  this perfectly worthless thing destroyed for the world. She was almost  angry with me for having thrown it away; almost angry with Miss Garth for  asking what she could possibly want with it! Could there be any plainer  proof than this that our misfortunes--falling so much more heavily on her  than on me--have quite unhinged her, and worn her out? Surely her words  and looks are not to be interpreted against her, when she is not sufficiently  mistress of herself to exert her natural judgment--when she shows the unreasonable  petulance of a child on a question which is not of the slightest importance.    ""A little after eleven we went upstairs to try if we could get some  rest.    ""I drew aside the curtain of my window and looked out. Oh, what a cruel  last night it was: no moon, no stars; such deep darkness that not one of  the dear familiar objects in the garden was visible when I looked for them;  such deep stillness that even my own movements about the room almost frightened  me! I tried to lie down and sleep, but the sense of loneliness came again  and quite overpowered me. You will say I am old enough, at six-and-twenty,  to have exerted more control over myself. I hardly know how it happened,  but I stole into Magdalen's room, just as I used to steal into it years  and years ago, when we were children. She was not in bed; she was sitting  with her writing materials before her, thinking. I said I wanted to be  with her the last night; and she kissed me, and told me to lie down, and  promised soon to follow me. My mind was a little quieted and I fell asleep.  It was daylight when I woke--and the first sight I saw was Magdalen, still  sitting in the chair, and still thinking. She had never been to bed; she  had not slept all through the night.    ""'I shall sleep when we have left Combe-Raven,' she said. 'I shall be  better when it is all over, and I have bid Frank good-by.' She had in her  hand our father's will, and the letter he wrote to you; and when she had  done speaking, she gave them into my possession. I was the eldest (she  said), and those last precious relics ought to be in my keeping. I tried  to propose to her that we should divide them; but she shook her head. 'I  have copied for myself,' was her answer, 'all that he says of us in the  will, and all that he says in the letter.' She told me this, and took from  her bosom a tiny white silk bag, which she had made in the night, and in  which she had put the extracts, so as to keep them always about her. 'This  tells me in his own words what his last wishes were for both of us,' she  said; 'and this is all I want for the future.' ""These are trifles to dwell  on; and I am almost surprised at myself for not feeling ashamed to trouble  you with them. But, since I have known what your early connection was with  my father and mother, I have learned to think of you (and, I suppose, to  write to you) as an old friend. And, besides, I have it so much at heart  to change your opinion of Magdalen, that I can't help telling you the smallest  things about her which may, in my judgment, end in making you think of  her as I do.    ""When breakfast-time came (on Thursday morning), we were surprised to  find a strange letter on the table. Perhaps I ought to mention it to you,  in case of any future necessity for your interference. It was addressed  to Miss Garth, on paper with the deepest mourning-border round it; and  the writer was the same man who followed us on our way home from a walk  one day last spring--Captain Wragge. His object appears to be to assert  once more his audacious claim to a family connection with my poor mother,  under cover of a letter of condolence; which it is an insolence in such  a person to have written at all. He expresses as much sympathy--on his  discovery of our affliction in the newspaper--as if he had been really  intimate with us; and he begs to know, in a postscript (being evidently  in total ignorance of all that has really happened), whether it is thought  desirable that he should be present, among the other relatives, at the  reading of the will! The address he gives, at which letters will reach  him for the next fortnight, is, 'Post-office, Birmingham.' This is all  I have to tell you on the subject. Both the letter and the writer seem  to me to be equally unworthy of the slightest notice, on our part or on  yours.    ""After breakfast Magdalen left us, and went by herself into the morning-room.  The weather being still showery, we had arranged that Francis Clare should  see her in that room, when he presented himself to take his leave. I was  upstairs when he came; and I remained upstairs for more than half an hour  afterward, sadly anxious, as you may well believe, on Magdalen's account.    ""At the end of the half-hour or more, I came downstairs. As I reached  the landing I suddenly heard her voice, raised entreatingly, and calling  on him by his name--then loud sobs--then a frightful laughing and screaming,  both together, that rang through the house. I instantly ran into the room,  and found Magdalen on the sofa in violent hysterics, and Frank standing  staring at her, with a lowering, angry face, biting his nails.    ""I felt so indignant--without knowing plainly why, for I was ignorant,  of course, of what had passed at the interview--that I took Mr. Francis  Clare by the shoulders and pushed him out of the room. I am careful to  tell you how I acted toward him, and what led to it; because I understand  that he is excessively offended with me, and that he is likely to mention  elsewhere what he calls my unladylike violence toward him. If he should  mention it to you, I am anxious to acknowledge, of my own accord, that  I forgot myself--not, I hope you will think, without some provocation.    ""I pushed him into the hall, leaving Magdalen, for the moment, to Miss  Garth's care. Instead of going away, he sat down sulkily on one of the  hall chairs. 'May I ask the reason of this extraordinary violence?' he  inquired, with an injured look. 'No,' I said. 'You will be good enough  to imagine the reason for yourself, and to leave us immediately, if you  please.' He sat doggedly in the chair, biting his nails and considering.  'What have I done to be treated in this unfeeling manner?' he asked, after  a while. 'I can enter into no discussion with you,' I answered; 'I can  only request you to leave us. If you persist in waiting to see my sister  again, I will go to the cottage myself and appeal to your father.' He got  up in a great hurry at those words. 'I have been infamously used in this  business,' he said. 'All the hardships and the sacrifices have fallen to  my share. I'm the only one among you who has any heart: all the rest are  as hard as stones--Magdalen included. In one breath she says she loves  me, and in another she tells me to go to China. What have I done to be  treated with this heartless inconsistency? I am consistent myself--I only  want to stop at home--and (what's the consequence?) you're all against  me!' In that manner he grumbled his way down the steps, and so I saw the  last of him. This was all that passed between us. If he gives you any other  account of it, what he says will be false. He made no attempt to return.  An hour afterward his father came alone to say good-by. He saw Miss Garth  and me, but not Magdalen; and he told us he would take the necessary measures,  with your assistance, for having his son properly looked after in London,  and seen safely on board the vessel when the time came. It was a short  visit, and a sad leave-taking. Even Mr. Clare was sorry, though he tried  hard to hide it.    ""We had barely two hours, after Mr. Clare had left us, before it would  be time to go. I went back to Magdalen, and found her quieter and better,  though terribly pale and exhausted, and oppressed, as I fancied, by thoughts  which she could not prevail on herself to communicate. She would tell me  nothing then--she has told me nothing since--of what passed between herself  and Francis Clare. When I spoke of him angrily (feeling as I did that he  had distressed and tortured her, when she ought to have had all the encouragement  and comfort from him that man could give), she refused to hear me: she  made the kindest allowances and the sweetest excuses for him, and laid  all the blame of the dreadful state in which I had found her entirely on  herself. Was I wrong in telling you that she had a noble nature? And won't  you alter your opinion when you read these lines?    ""We had no friends to come and bid us good-by; and our few acquaintances  were too far from us--perhaps too indifferent about us--to call. We employed  the little leisure left in going over the house together for the last time.  We took leave of our old schoolroom, our bedrooms, the room where our mother  died, the little study where our father used to settle his accounts and  write his letters--feeling toward them, in our forlorn condition, as other  girls might have felt at parting with old friends. From the house, in a  gleam of fine weather, we went into the garden, and gathered our last nosegay;  with the purpose of drying the flowers when they begin to wither, and keeping  them in remembrance of the happy days that are gone. When we had said good-by  to the garden, there was only half an hour left. We went together to the  grave; we knelt down, side by side, in silence, and kissed the sacred ground.  I thought my heart would have broken. August was the month of my mother's  birthday; and, this time last year, my father and Magdalen and I were all  consulting in secret what present we could make to surprise her with on  the birthday morning.    ""If you had seen how Magdalen suffered, you would never doubt her again.  I had to take her from the last resting-place of our father and mother  almost by force. Before we were out of the churchyard she broke from me  and ran back. She dropped on her knees at the grave; tore up from it passionately  a handful of grass; and said something to herself, at the same moment,  which, though I followed her instantly, I did not get near enough to hear.  She turned on me in such a frenzied manner, when I tried to raise her from  the ground--she looked at me with such a fearful wildness in her eyes--that  I felt absolutely terrified at the sight of her. To my relief, the paroxysm  left her as suddenly as it had come. She thrust away the tuft of grass  into the bosom of her dress, and took my arm and hurried with me out of  the churchyard. I asked her why she had gone back--I asked what those words  were which she had spoken at the grave. 'A promise to our dead father,'  she answered, with a momentary return of the wild look and the frenzied  manner which had startled me already. I was afraid to agitate her by saying  more; I left all other questions to be asked at a fitter and a quieter  time. You will understand from this how terribly she suffers, how wildly  and strangely she acts under violent agitation; and you will not interpret  against her what she said or did when you saw her on Wednesday last.    ""We only returned to the house in time to hasten away from it to the  train. Perhaps it was better for us so--better that we had only a moment  left to look back before the turn in the road hid the last of Combe-Raven  from our view. There was not a soul we knew at the station; nobody to stare  at us, nobody to wish us good-by. The rain came on again as we took our  seats in the train. What we felt at the sight of the railway--what horrible  remembrances it forced on our minds of the calamity which has made us fatherless--I  cannot, and dare not, tell you. I have tried anxiously not to write this  letter in a gloomy tone; not to return all your kindness to us by distressing  you with our grief. Perhaps I have dwelt too long already on the little  story of our parting from home? I can only say, in excuse, that my heart  is full of it; and what is not in my heart my pen won't write.    ""We have been so short a time in our new abode that I have nothing more  to tell you--except that Miss Garth's sister has received us with the heartiest  kindness. She considerately leaves us to ourselves, until we are fitter  than we are now to think of our future plans, and to arrange as we best  can for earning our own living. The house is so large, and the position  of our rooms has been so thoughtfully chosen, that I should hardly know--except  when I hear the laughing of the younger girls in the garden--that we were  living in a school.    ""With kindest and best wishes from Miss Garth and my sister, believe  me, dear Mr. Pendril, gratefully yours,  ""NORAH VANSTONE.""       II. From Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril. ""Westmoreland House, Kensington,  ""September 23d, 1846.    ""MY DEAR SIR--I write these lines in such misery of mind as no words  can describe. Magdalen has deserted us. At an early hour this morning she  secretly left the house, and she has not been heard of since.    ""I would come and speak to you personally; but I dare not leave Norah.  I must try to control myself; I must try to write.    ""Nothing happened yesterday to prepare me or to prepare Norah for this  last--I had almost said, this worst--of all our afflictions. The only alteration  we either of us noticed in the unhappy girl was an alteration for the better  when we parted for the night. She kissed me, which she has not done latterly;  and she burst out crying when she embraced her sister next. We had so little  suspicion of the truth that we thought these signs of renewed tenderness  and affection a promise of better things for the future.    ""This morning, when her sister went into her room, it was empty, and  a note in her handwriting, addressed to Norah, was lying on the dressing-table.  I cannot prevail on Norah to part with the note; I can only send you the  inclosed copy of it. You will see that it affords no clew to the direction  she has taken.    ""Knowing the value of time, in this dreadful emergency, I examined her  room, and (with my sister's help) questioned the servants immediately on  the news of her absence reaching me. Her wardrobe was empty; and all her  boxes but one, which she has evidently taken away with her, are empty,  too. We are of opinion that she has privately turned her dresses and jewelry  into money; that she had the one trunk she took with her removed from the  house yesterday; and that she left us this morning on foot. The answers  given by one of the servants are so unsatisfactory that we believe the  woman has been bribed to assist her; and has managed all those arrangements  for her flight which she could not have safely undertaken by herself.    ""Of the immediate object with which she has left us, I entertain no  doubt.    ""I have reasons (which I can tell you at a fitter time) for feeling  assured that she has gone away with the intention of trying her fortune  on the stage. She has in her possession the card of an actor by profession,  who superintended an amateur theatrical performance at Clifton, in which  she took part; and to him she has gone to help her. I saw the card at the  time, and I know the actor's name to be Huxtable. The address I cannot  call to mind quite so correctly; but I am almost sure it was at some theatrical  place in Bow Street, Covent Garden. Let me entreat you not to lose a moment  in sending to make the necessary inquiries; the first trace of her will,  I firmly believe, be found at that address.    ""If we had nothing worse to dread than her attempting to go on the stage,  I should not feel the distress and dismay which now overpower me. Hundreds  of other girls have acted as recklessly as she has acted, and have not  ended ill after all. But my fears for Magdalen do not begin and end with  the risk she is running at present.    ""There has been something weighing on her mind ever since we left Combe-Raven--weighing  far more heavily for the last six weeks than at first. Until the period  when Francis Clare left England, I am persuaded she was secretly sustained  by the hope that he would contrive to see her again. From the day when  she knew that the measures you had taken for preventing this had succeeded;  from the day when she was assured that the ship had really taken him away,  nothing has roused, nothing has interested her. She has given herself up,  more and more hopelessly, to her own brooding thoughts; thoughts which  I believe first entered her mind on the day when the utter ruin of the  prospects on which her marriage depended was made known to her. She has  formed some desperate project of contesting the possession of her father's  fortune with Michael Vanstone; and the stage career which she has gone  away to try is nothing more than a means of freeing herself from all home  dependence, and of enabling her to run what mad risks she pleases, in perfect  security from all home control. What it costs me to write of her in these  terms, I must leave you to imagine. The time has gone by when any consideration  of distress to my own feelings can weigh with me. Whatever I can say which  will open your eyes to the real danger, and strengthen your conviction  of the instant necessity of averting it, I say in despite of myself, without  hesitation and without reserve.    ""One word more, and I have done.    ""The last time you were so good as to come to this house, do you remember  how Magdalen embarrassed and distressed us by questioning you about her  right to bear her father's name? Do you remember her persisting in her  inquiries, until she had forced you to acknowledge that, legally speaking,  she and her sister had No Name? I venture to remind you of this, because  you have the affairs of hundreds of clients to think of, and you might  well have forgotten the circumstance. Whatever natural reluctance she might  otherwise have had to deceiving us, and degrading herself, by the use of  an assumed name, that conversation with you is certain to have removed.  We must discover her by personal description--we can trace her in no other  way.    ""I can think of nothing more to guide your decision in our deplorable  emergency. For God's sake, let no expense and no efforts be spared. My  letter ought to reach you by ten o'clock this morning, at the latest. Let  me have one line in answer, to say you will act instantly for the best.  My only hope of quieting Norah is to show her a word of encouragement from  your pen. Believe me, dear sir, yours sincerely and obliged,  HARRIET GARTH.""       III. From Magdalen to Norah (inclosed in the preceding Letter). ""MY DARLING--Try to forgive me. I have struggled against myself till  I am worn out in the effort. I am the wretchedest of living creatures.  Our quiet life here maddens me; I can bear it no longer; I must go. If  you knew what my thoughts are; if you knew how hard I have fought against  them, and how horribly they have gone on haunting me in the lonely quiet  of this house, you would pity and forgive me. Oh, my love, don't feel hurt  at my not opening my heart to you as I ought! I dare not open it. I dare  not show myself to you as I really am.    ""Pray don't send and seek after me; I will write and relieve all your  anxieties. You know, Norah, we must get our living for ourselves; I have  only gone to get mine in the manner which is fittest for me. Whether I  succeed, or whether I fail, I can do myself no harm either way. I have  no position to lose, and no name to degrade. Don't doubt I love you--don't  let Miss Garth doubt my gratitude. I go away miserable at leaving you;  but I must go. If I had loved you less dearly, I might have had the courage  to say this in your presence--but how could I trust myself to resist your  persuasions, and to bear the sight of your distress? Farewell, my darling!  Take a thousand kisses from me, my own best, dearest love, till we meet  again.  MAGDALEN.""       IV. From Sergeant Bulmer (of the Detective Police) to Mr. Pendril. ""Scotland Yard, September 29th, 1846.    ""SIR--Your clerk informs me that the parties interested in our inquiry  after the missing young lady are anxious for news of the same. I went to  your office to speak to you about the matter to-day. Not having found you,  and not being able to return and try again to-morrow, I write these lines  to save delay, and to tell you how we stand thus far.    ""I am sorry to say, no advance has been made since my former report.  The trace of the young lady which we found nearly a week since, still remains  the last trace discovered of her. This case seems a mighty simple one looked  at from a distance. Looked at close, it alters very considerably for the  worse, and becomes, to speak the plain truth--a Poser.    ""This is how we now stand:    ""We have traced the young lady to the theatrical agent's in Bow Street.  We know that at an early hour on the morning of the twenty-third the agent  was called downstairs, while he was dressing, to speak to a young lady  in a cab at the door. We know that, on her production of Mr. Huxtable's  card, he wrote on it Mr. Huxtable's address in the country, and heard her  order the cabman to drive to the Great Northern terminus. We believe she  left by the nine o'clock train. We followed her by the twelve o'clock train.  We have ascertained that she called at half-past two at Mr. Huxtable's  lodgings; that she found he was away, and not expected back till eight  in the evening; that she left word she would call again at eight; and that  she never returned. Mr. Huxtable's statement is--he and the young lady  have never set eyes on each other. The first consideration which follows,  is this: Are we to believe Mr. Huxtable? I have carefully inquired into  his character; I know as much, or more, about him than he knows about himself;  and my opinion is, that we are to believe him. To the best of my  knowledge, he is a perfectly honest man.    ""Here, then, is the hitch in the case. The young lady sets out with  a certain object before her. Instead of going on to the accomplishment  of that object, she stops short of it. Why has she stopped? and where?  Those are, unfortunately, just the questions which we can't answer yet.    ""My own opinion of the matter is, briefly, as follows: I don't think  she has met with any serious accident. Serious accidents, in nine cases  out of ten, discover themselves. My own notion is, that she has fallen  into the hands of some person or persons interested in hiding her away,  and sharp enough to know how to set about it. Whether she is in their charge,  with or without her own consent, is more than I can undertake to say at  present. I don't wish to raise false hopes or false fears; I wish to stop  short at the opinion I have given already.    ""In regard to the future, I may tell you that I have left one of my  men in daily communication with the authorities. I have also taken care  to have the handbills offering a reward for the discovery of her widely  circulated. Lastly, I have completed the necessary arrangements for seeing  the play-bills of all country theaters, and for having the dramatic companies  well looked after. Some years since, this would have cost a serious expenditure  of time and money. Luckily for our purpose, the country theaters are in  a bad way. Excepting the large cities, hardly one of them is open, and  we can keep our eye on them, with little expense and less difficulty.    ""These are the steps which I think it needful to take at present. If  you are of another opinion, you have only to give me your directions, and  I will carefully attend to the same. I don't by any means despair of our  finding the young lady and bringing her back to her friends safe and well.  Please to tell them so; and allow me to subscribe myself, yours respectfully,  ""ABRAHAM BULMER.""       V. Anonymous Letter addressed to Mr. Pendril. ""SIR--A word to the wise. The friends of a certain young lady are wasting  time and money to no purpose. Your confidential clerk and your detective  policeman are looking for a needle in a bottle of hay. This is the ninth  of October, and they have not found her yet: they will as soon find the  Northwest Passage. Call your dogs off; and you may hear of the young lady's  safety under her own hand. The longer you look for her, the longer she  will remain, what she is now--lost.""

1047,Uncle Tom's Cabin,116,Harriet Beecher Stowe,Chapter10,"Pride and Prejudice: Chapter 50   [Previous Chapter] [Table  of Contents]    Chapter VIII  MR. BENNET had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,  instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for  the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived  him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect,  Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or  credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on  one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband  might then have rested in its proper place.     He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage  to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law,  and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,  and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.     When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly  useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join  in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow  and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters  successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet,  for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This  event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence  had alone prevented their exceeding their income.     Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.  Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst  the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with  regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could  have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of  grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed  most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all  that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been  made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed  on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience  to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds  a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with  her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which  passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very  little within that sum.     That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,  too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was  to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports  of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally  returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for  though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother;  but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.     The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate  speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent  philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation,  had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,  been secluded from the world in some distant farm house. But there was  much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her  well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies  in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances,  because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.     It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but  on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and  in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her  triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of  her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment,  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant  nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching  through the neighbourhood for a ``proper situation'' for her daughter,  and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected  many as deficient in size and importance.     ``Haye-Park might do,'' said she, ``if the Gouldings would quit  it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth  is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as  for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.''     Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while  the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, ``Mrs.  Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter,  let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood,  they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of  either by receiving them at Longbourn.''     A long dispute followed this declaration, but Mr. Bennet was firm;  it soon led to another, and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,  that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever  on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger  could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse  his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem  valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive  to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's  nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham  a fortnight before they took place.     Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress  of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for  her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination  to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning  from all those who were not immediately on the spot.     She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There  were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;  but at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty  would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage  from it individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable  between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable  terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with  a family where, to every other objection would now be added an alliance  and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.     From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his  feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a  blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she  hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no  longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there  seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that  she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should  meet.     What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that  the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would  now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted  not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal, there must  be a triumph.     She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in  disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper,  though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union  that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness,  his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment,  information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit  of greater importance. But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring  multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency,  and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their  family.     How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,  she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong  to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were  stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.        Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments  he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare  of any of his family, and concluded with intreaties that the subject might  never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was  to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.     ``It was greatly my wish that he should do so,'' he added, ``as  soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me in  considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his  account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars;  and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing  to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General  ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have  it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and, I hope,  among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve,  they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform  him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the  various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of  speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself  the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton,  of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information. He has given  in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has  our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join  his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand  from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before  she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered  to you and her mother. -- Your's, &c.     E. GARDINER.''     Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's  removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.  Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company -- for  she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire  -- was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia  should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body,  and had so many favourites.     ``She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,'' said she, ``it will be quite  shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too,  that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General  ----'s regiment.''     His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being  admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received  at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing,  for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should  be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet  so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn  as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they  thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction  of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the  neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote  again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come;  and it was settled that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should  proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should  consent to such a scheme; and, had she consulted only her own inclination,  any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.
